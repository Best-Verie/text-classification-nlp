several TKIs such as axitinib cabozantinibge\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081tinib lenvatinib imatinib motesanib sorafenib pazopanibsunitinib and vandetanib have been studied in phase I IIand III clinical trials

was approved bythe FDA in  after a phase III trial demonstrated improvedmedian PFS of  months relative to  months in theplacebo group    The impact of toxicity on patientswas clearly indicated and for cabozantinib  of patientsrequired dose reductions and  required dosing delays Therefore toxicity of FDAapproved TKI agents limits their usein patients with small volume asymptomatic or indolent

induce tumorspeci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081c cellular cytotoxicity This case report may demonstrate the potential for therapeuticcancer vaccines to synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitionsequentially in MTC and that principle could be applied as well toother cancers that may have tumor microenvironments TMEsdevoid of baseline immune recognition The therapeutic cancervaccine in this trial was a heatkilled yeastbased vaccine designedto stimulate an immune response against CEA After a phase Itrial demonstrated safety transient injection site reaction wasthe most common adverse event and preliminary evidence ofimmunologic and clinical activity a phase II study was developedin MTC NCT01856920  The phase I study included apatient with MTC who had substantial \\u0082ammation at sitesof disease that followed  months of the vaccine  It isalso possible that the patient\\u0099s previous sunitinib is relevant inthis case report In a model using CEAtransgenic mice bearingCEA tumors continuous sunitinib followed by vaccine increasedintratumoral\\u0081ltration of antigenspeci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081c T lymphocytesdecreased immunosuppressant Tregs and MDSCs reducedtumor volumes and increased survival The immunomodulatoryactivity of continuous sunitinib administration can create a moreimmunepermissive environment Despite the significant recent advances of antiPD1 andantiPDL1 therapy they still impact only a minority of patientswhose TMEs express those molecules at baseline One hypothesisis that sequential use of vaccine can drive immune cells to theTME resulting in an adaptive reaction by tumor cells potentiallyfrom the presence of cytokines produced by active immune cellsin the TME upregulating PDL1 and perhaps de\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081ning a rolefor antiPDL1PD1 therapies in patients who may not haveotherwise bene\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081ted from such immunotherapies   Basedon this perspective combining or sequencing vaccines with antiPDL1PD1 therapies could broaden the clinical bene\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081t for allpatients with immunologically \\u009ccold tumor microenvironments\\u009ddevoid of reactive immune cells to enhance the clinical e\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0083cacyamong cancer patients with a variety of tumor types This casemay provide an example of how increasing peripheral Tcellactivation with vaccines can enable immune cells to then migrateto the TME and improve response rates to antiPDL1PD1therapies   Indeed existing data with the FDAapprovedtherapeutic cancer vaccine for prostate cancer sipuleucelTindicate that vaccine did increase T cells in the TME aftertreatment Induction of CEAspeci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081c T cells was noted in the peripheralblood of this patient following vaccination with yeastCEA butnot at later time points It is possible the CEAspeci\\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0081c cellshomed in on the TME inducing PDL1 expression subsequentlyFrontiers in Endocrinology  wwwfrontiersinAugust   Volume    0cDel Rivero et alMTCseen on the tumor In addition \\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0082uctuations in the peripheralimmunome were noted in this patient over the course of therapywith yeastCEA vaccine and subsequent avelumab therapythese changes included both immunepotentiating and immunesuppressive alterations with the most notable \\u00ef\\u00ac\\u0082uctuationsoccurring after several administrations of avelumab The increasein suppressive elements may be a compensatory mechanisminduced to tamper down the immune activation induced by thedi\\u00ef\\u00acerent immunotherapy treatments However as this patienthad metastatic diseaseit is unknown whether the changesin the peripheralimmunome were directly induced by thesequential immunotherapy regimens or potentially related todisease progressionAs with all case reports these presentations have limitationsthe fact that the patient did not have a biopsy at baseline prior tostarting the vaccine limits understanding of the baseline TMEThus it is unclear if the vaccine drove PDL1 expression orif it was preexisting in this patient Little data exist for thepresence of PDL1 expression on MTC tumor cells To furthercomplicate this case\\u0099s assessment the

dehydrogenase complex and transketolase inhibition. However inhibition of the same enzyme was shown to result in different metabolic consequences in the case of BCKDH where inhibition in RS4 cells caused a demonstrable increase in BCKDH substrates whereas in MCF-7 cells inhibition led to a decrease in the products of the enzymatic reaction. This difference may then lead to different consequences on cell growth as the substrates for BCKDH are known to be toxic metabolites and result in the an toxicity in the metabolic syndrome maple syrup urine disease. We have previously shown that RS4 cells as well as other lymphoid leukemia cell lines have a biphasic dose response to thiaminase where there is an initial growth inhibition related to extracellular thiamine depletion and a cytotoxic response at higher concentrations related to intracellular thiamine depletion [7]. Gabapentin appears to be protective against the growth inhibitory effects of thiaminase in RS4 cells at the concentrations that produce extracellular thiamine depletion indicating that growth inhibition is not due solely to thiamine depletion but also to the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolites. These studies demonstrate that the cell lines and presumable tumors have different metabolic consequences resulting from inhibition of the same enzymes and that these consequences may form the basis of sensitivity to TDE inhibition as well as identify potential biomarkers of response. In addition thiaminase treatment was associated with increased lipolysis and decreased polyamine synthesis (data not shown) both of which were reversed by co-treatment with rapamycin. These changes are consistent with altered energy production and reduced cellular proliferation as a result of thiamine depletion but also may be related to our previous observation that mammary tumor formation is delayed in mice fed a low-thiamine normal-fat diet but not in mice fed a low-thiamine high-fat diet [4]. Although fatty acid metabolism may be affected by inhibition of 2-hydroxyl-CoA lyase (HACL1) a peroxisomal enzyme that also requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor and mediates the catabolism of branched chain fatty acids and 2-hydroxyl straight chain fatty acids [17] we did not see any evidence for accumulation of these metabolites in either cell line. Conclusions Overall these studies demonstrate that TDE disruption leads to specific metabolic consequences that are predictable from its role as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze important steps in energy production biomass generation and amino acid catabolism. Comparison of the changes observed with thiaminase treatment in RS4 cells versus MCF-7 cells reveals different biochemical signatures as a result of thiamine depletion that may reflect differences in the relative contributions of different pathways to energy production and anaplerotic contributions to the TCA cycle. The near-global reversal of the specific metabolic effects of thiaminase by rapamycin indicate a closer regulation of thiamine-dependent metabolism by mTOR than has been previously appreciated and further studies are needed to determine how mTOR signaling pathways regulates thiamine-dependent metabolism. The disruption of thiamine metabolism results in cytotoxicity in breast cancer and leukemia tumor model systems and has the potential to provide novel targets for therapies directed toward these malignancies.

Exploring novel approaches to treatment of these subtypes is critical since less than 30% of women with metastatic breast cancer survive five years and virtually all women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of their disease despite systemic therapy. To date not a single targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of TNBC and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. We will discuss the current and upcoming therapeutic strategies being explored in an attempt to \\u009ctarget\\u009d TNBC.

Estimating and informing women of their risk is essential for tailoring appropriate screening and risk reduction strategies. Methods: Data were collected for BreastCARE a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate a PC-tablet based intervention providing multiethnic women and their primary care physicians with tailored information about breast cancer risk. We included women ages 40\\u009374 visiting general internal medicine primary care clinics at one academic practice and one safety net practice who spoke English Spanish or Cantonese and had no personal history of breast cancer. We collected baseline information regarding risk perception and concern. Women were categorized as high risk (vs. average risk) if their family history met criteria for referral to genetic counseling or if they were in the top 5% of risk for their age based on the Gail or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Model (BCSC) breast cancer risk model. Results: Of 1261 participants 25% (N=314) were classified as high risk. More average risk than high risk women had correct risk perception (72% vs. 18%); 25% of both average and high risk women reported being very concerned about breast cancer. Average risk women with correct risk perception were less likely to be concerned about breast cancer (odds ratio [OR]=0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.2\\u00930.4) while high risk women with correct risk perception were more likely to be concerned about breast cancer (OR=5.1; 95%CI=2.7\\u00939.6). Conclusions: Many women did not accurately perceive their risk for breast cancer. Women with accurate risk perception had an appropriate level of concern about breast cancer. Improved methods of assessing and informing women of their breast cancer risk could motivate high risk women to apply appropriate prevention strategies and allay unnecessary concern among average risk women.

This study aimed to determine whether patients with prostate cancer have EN2 autoantibodies what the prevalence of these antibodies is and whether they are associated with disease stage. The spontaneous immunoglobulin (Ig)G immune response against EN2 and for comparison the tumour antigen New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in three different cohorts of prostate cancer patients as well as a group of men genetically predisposed to prostate cancer. Thirty-two of 353 (9\\u00b71%) of the SUN cohort representing all stages of prostate cancer demonstrated EN2 IgG responses 12 of 107 patients (11\\u00b72%) in the advanced prostate cancer patients showed responses while only four of 121 patients (3\\u00b73%) with castrate-resistant prostate cancer showed EN2 autoantibodies.

Anti-EN2 IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to healthy control males and similarly prevalent to anti-NY-ESO-1 responses.

Background Increased collagen deposition provides physical and biochemical signals to support tumor growth and invasion during breast cancer development. Therefore inhibition of collagen synthesis and deposition has been considered a strategy to suppress breast cancer progression. Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase ? subunit 2 (P4HA2) an enzyme hydroxylating proline residues in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences is a potential therapeutic target for the disorders associated with increased collagen deposition. However expression and function of P4HA2 in breast cancer progression are not well investigated. Methods Gene co-expression analysis was performed in the published microarray datasets to identify potential regulators of collagen I III and IV in human breast cancer tissue. Expression of P4HA2 was silenced by shRNAs and its activity was inhibited by 1 4-DPCA a prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor. Three-dimensional culture assay was used to analyze roles of P4HA2 in regulating malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Reduced deposition of collagen I and IV was detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Control and P4HA2-silenced breast cancer cells were injected into fat pad and tail vein of SCID mice to examine effect of P4HA2 on tumor growth and lung metastasis. Results Using gene co-expression analysis we showed that P4HA2 was associated with expression of Col1A1 Col3A1 and Col4A1 during breast cancer development and progression. P4HA2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in breast cancer compared to normal mammary tissue. Increased mRNA levels of P4HA2 correlated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients which is independent of estrogen receptor status. Silencing P4HA2 expression or treatment with the P4HA inhibitor significantly inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells in 3D culture accompanied by reduced deposition of collagen I and IV. We also found that knockdown of P4HA2 inhibited mammary tumor growth and metastasis to lungs in xenograft models. Conclusion These results suggest the critical role of P4HA2 in breast cancer progression and identify P4HA2 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for breast cancer progression. Tumor microenvironment Breast cancer Collagen deposition Cancer progression Cell proliferation Background Extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important component of tumor microenvironment and plays critical roles in cancer development [1-3]. Collagens are the major structural ECM proteins and form fibers or networks in tumor tissue [4-6]. Cell-collagen interaction controls a variety of cellular activities including proliferation migration and invasion through integrin and discoidin domain receptor [7-9]. Enhanced expression and deposition of collagens are associated with tumor development and progression [10-12]. Recent studies demonstrate that increased collagen deposition and crosslinking enhance the stiffness and density of mammary tissue [51013] which is an important risk factor for breast cancer development. Type I collagen has been identified as a prognosis marker and is associated with cancer recurrence in human breast cancer patients [14]. Collagen VI knockout mice have reduced primary tumor formation and growth [12] while enhancing collagen deposition and inhibiting collagen degradation significantly enhances tumor initiation and tumor growth [510]. In addition cancer cell invasion usually occurs at tumor-stromal interfaces with oriented collagen fibers and aligned collagen fibers can facilitate cell migration and metastasis [5101115]. These results indicate that increased collagen expression and deposition promotes breast cancer development and progression by enhancing tumor growth and invasion. Therefore inhibiting collagen synthesis or deposition is a promising strategy to suppress breast cancer progression. Collagen biosynthesis is a multistep process that involves several post-transcription modification enzymes and one of the most important members of these enzymes is collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase [16]. It catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline by hydroxylating proline residues in -X-Pro-Gly- sequences [17-20]. Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase resides within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [18] and its expression is used as a marker for collagen synthesis [2122]. Because 4-hydroxyproline residues formed in this reaction are essential for triple helix formation and stabilization of collagen [22-24] inhibiting the prolyl-4-hydroxylases activity efficiently blocks collagen synthesis and deposition. All known vertebrate collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases are ?2?2 tetramers consisting of two ? subunits and two ? subunits. Each ? subunit contains the peptide substrate binding domain and the two catalytic sites of the enzyme and the ? subunits have been identified as protein disulfide isomerases [171925]. Three types of collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases ? isoforms (P4HA1 P4HA2 and P4HA3) have been identified in human tissue. P4HA1 is expressed in most cell types; P4HA2 is mainly expressed in chondrocytes osteoblasts and capillary endothelial cells; P4HA3 expression is detected in adult and fetal tissues at very low levels compared to P4HA1 and P4HA2 [1826]. Increased P4HA2 expression has been detected in many solid tumors including oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma papillary thyroid cancer and breast cancer [27-30] however the function of P4HA2 in cancer progression largely remains to be determined. Here we showed that expression of P4HA2 and collagen genes (Col1A1 Col3A1 and Col4A1) is significantly correlated during breast cancer development and progression and that increased mRNA levels of P4HA2 are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Silencing P4HA2 or treatment with the P4HA inhibitor attenuates cell proliferation and suppresses aggressive 3D phenotypes tumor growth and cancer metastasis\\\"\",\n          \"American  Joint

new  cases  malefemale      and   deaths malefemale   were reported in  countries  around  the  world  respectively  accounting  for   and  of all new cancer cases and deaths4 On the one hand due to the great influence of medical ultrasound and cytologicalpuncture diagnosis the proportion of PTMC in new cases of TC has increased significantly According to the  data  the  overall  incidence  of  PTMC  in  the  United States  has  increased  by    over  the  past    years with  average  annual  new  cases  accounting  for  about \\u0093 On the other hand PTMC incidence in the elderly is significantly higher than that in the general adult population  Some  studies  have  shown  that  the  average  annual growth rate of PTMC in patients  years old is  times that in adults  years old8\\u0093 These results indicate that we  should  pay  sufficient  attention  to  elderly  PTMC patients  As  the  8th  edition  of  the  AJCC  Cancer  Staging Manual raise PTC staging age from  to

been predicted to be the third leading cause of cancerrelated death in the european union by   and the second leading cause of cancerrelated death in the united states of america and germanyby   several factors contribute to the poor survival of pancreatic cancer patients a current lack of reliablediagnostic markers that would enable early screening   coupled with largely nonspecific symptoms

curativesurgery   disease recurs in over  of patients postresection   ultimately these factorsculminate in more than  of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer succumbing to disease  these

pancreaticmalignancypancreatic cancer can arise from either the endocrine or the exocrine region of the pancreas tumours arising fromthe exocrine compartment are termed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac and account for over  of allpancreatic cancers  pdac develops via a stepwise progression from normal tissue through to invasive lesions which is associated withdistinct morphological characteristics [] it has been proposed that this process begins with a phenomenontermed acinartoductal metaplasia adm which is a normal homeostatic mechanism whereby acinar cells transdifferentiate into a ductal phenotype in response to particular stimuli   however if compounded by an oncogenichit cells are pushed towards a pathogenic phenotype that develops into pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia panin[] disease progresses through preinvasive stages termed panin1a panin1b panin2 and panin3 priorto invasive pdac   this progression is associated with increasing nuclear atypia whereby the nuclei are no longerpositioned basally and loss of normal architecture as cells become more papillary in nature with panin3 lesionsdemonstrating increased mitoses   as disease progresses to pdac cells become invasive and breach the basement membrane growing through the extracellular matrix and metastasising to distant ans figure less common precursor lesions include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ipmns and mucinous cysticneoplasms mcns that also develop through multistep processes   whilst they share some common featureseach lesion is morphologically and genetically distinct in contrast with panins that form within small ducts ipmnsdevelop within the primary or secondary branches of the main pancreatic duct whilst mcns lack ductal involvement an ammatory tumour microenvironment contributes to pdacpathogenesisan archetypal feature of pdac is the development of extensive stromal networks within the tumour microenvironment tme that can account for up to  of the total tumour volume [] this unique characteristic drives theinflammatory nature of pdac that contributes to its aggressive phenotype   desmoplasia is driven by pancreaticstellate cells pscs and cancerassociated fibroblasts cafs that upon activation produce a range of extracellularmatrix ecm components such as collagen laminin and fibronectin which in turn form a physical barrier preventing the penetration of therapeutics [] though pscs and cafs have been shown to support cancer metastasis and drug resistance they interact with cancer cells in a bidirectional manner with each promoting the survivalgrowth and proliferation of the other [] quiescent fibroblasts are able to differentiate into two unique subtypes termed myofibroblastic cafs mycafs and inflammatory cafs icafs   these two subtypes are distinct whereby mycafs express high levels of Î±smooth muscle actin Î±sma and are located adjacent to cancercells while icafs express low levels of Î±sma and instead secrete high levels of inflammatory mediators including il6 and are distributed distant from cancer cells within desmoplastic tumour regions   broadly mycafsappear to have roles in epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt and ecm remodelling whilst icafs appear tobe involved in inflammation and ecm deposition   a third less abundant subtype termed antigenpresentingcafs apcafs has more recently been defined   these cells express low levels of both Î±sma and il6 andinstead express high levels of major histocompatibility complex class ii mhcii and related genes   as such allthree subtypes are transcriptionally and functionally distinctthe wider tme contains a plethora of other cell types including endothelial cells tumourassociated macrophagestams and neutrophils tans mast cells regulatory tcells myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs dendriticcells natural killer nk cells and nerve cells   interactions between various cells within the tme can driveeither proor antitumorigenic functions of others for example cancer cells can induce pscs to secrete inflammatorycytokines that drive immune cells towards an immunosuppressive phenotype and also form a positive feedback loopby increasing the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells   the ecm itself has also been suggested to modifypsc behaviour in particular that ecm stiffness promotes the mycaf phenotype indicated by increased Î±smaexpression   this results in substantial complexity that ultimately determines tumour phenotype  the components of the microenvironment modify tumour behaviour through the production of cytokines growthfactors and other signalling molecules that predominantly drive a proinflammatory and immunosuppressive program that enhances pdac tumour growth and progression []

invasive andormetastatic pdac this process is associated with acinartoductal metaplasia adm early in disease combined with an accumulation of oncogenic mutations most common mutations are indicated a number of cells within the tumour microenvironment havebeen shown to secrete il6 family cytokines which in turn results in the activation of a protumorigenic signalling cascade a betterunderstanding of the relationship between each of these cells within the tumour microenvironment may reveal new therapeuticopportunities to manage cancer progressionintrinsic resistance of disease   thus dual targeting of cancer cells and the tme may be required to induce afavourable therapeutic response although this poses a signficant scientific and clinical challenge []molecular basis of pathogenesispdac development is associated with accumulation of mutationsthe progression of tumorigenesis through panin and pdac stages is associated with the stepwise accumulation ofspecific genetic mutations that drive malignant transformation the most frequent genetic alteration is an activatingkras point mutation codon  that occurs early on in tumour development   and is detected in over  ofpdac tumours [] mutations in kras have been shown to drive development of precursor panin lesions andwhen combined with an appropriate tumour suppressor mutation these lesions progress to invasive

a range of tumour suppressor proteins is also common including mutations in tp53 cdkn2aand smad4 in approximately   and  of tumours respectively   whilst each mutation has uniquemechanistic outcomes all three proteins are either directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of the g1s cellcycle checkpoint analysis of patient tumours indicates that two or more of these mutations often occur together withcdkn2a mutation being combined with either tp53 smad4 or both usually in the background of kras mutation   this suggests that by disrupting this checkpoint cancer cells are able to overcome inhibitory mechanismsallowing continued progression to invasive diseaseunbiased sequencing efforts have also enabled identification of low prevalence pdac mutations observed in lessthan  of cases   these include mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification kdm6a  dnadamage repair atm  and other tumourrelated processes such as growth tgfbr1 or tgfbr2   furthermore it is important to note that technical advances are continuously uncovering epigenetic mechanisms thatfurther modulate the pdac transcriptional landscape and ultimately influence disease heterogeneity and tumourprogression  molecular subtypesthe pdac epithelial compartment is typically divided into two subtypes including a classical subtype exhibiting anepitheliallike expression profile and a squamous or mesenchymallike subtype   an additional third exocrinesubtype is outlined in some analyses and is characterised by a gene expression profile related to digestive enzymeproduction   the classical or epithelial subtype has also been further divided into a pancreatic progenitor andan immunogenic subtype whereby the immunogenic subtype is distinguished by significant immune infiltration andassociated gene programmes   though there is no consensus on which classification system will allow the mostvaluable stratification of patients the mesenchymal subtype is invariably associated with a poor prognosis  the stromal compartment has also been classified into either normal or activated subtypes reflecting the proandantitumorigenic capabilities of the tme with the activated subtype associated with reduced survival   this isparticularly valuable as the extensive heterogeneity of pdac complicates clinically relevant stratification of patientsthus the identification of molecularly unique subtypes may enable development of tailored therapeutic regimensthat will provide improved clinical outcomescurrent treatment optionsregardless of disease stage at time of diagnosis patients have relatively limited treatment options for the majorityof patients disease will be locally advanced or metastatic disqualifying them from undergoing potentially curativesurgery   in these cases patients are typically offered chemotherapy with palliative intent []surgery provides the only potentially curative treatmentsurgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment option

become eligible for surgery   however a range of recent trials have shown improved clinical outcomes including overall survival for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with resectable tumours  following surgical resection patients are typically treated with adjuvant gemcitabinebased chemotherapy  although a recent study showed improved diseasefree survival and overall survival with a modified folfirinoxtherapy combination of oxaliplatin irinotecan leucovorin and fluorouracil  radiotherapy provides variable clinical outcomewhilst the use of radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy combination chemo and radiotherapy in the neoadjuvantand adjuvant settings have been investigated there remains a lack of consensus regarding therapeutic benefit  this is due to issues such as insufficient radiation dose and low participant numbers as well as low uptake of moderntechniques   in the neoadjuvant setting preliminary studies reported reduced lymph node positivity and rates oflocal recurrence for chemoradiotherapy compared to surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy   however the useof radiotherapy in the palliative setting was reported to modestly reduce overall survival   more recent studiesusing ablative doses of radiation have shown a survival benefit highlighting that technological advancements mayprovide an avenue for improved clinical outcomes following radiotherapy

had increased toxicity andadverse events thus preventing its administration to patients with multiple comorbidities  therapeutic resistance remains a signiï¬cant barrier to patient survivaldespite advances in chemotherapeutic options treatment efficacy and patient prognosis remain poor due to the inherent therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer it has been proposed that this drug resistance may be driven by thetme including changes to cytokine signalling and metabolic pathways [] this intrinsic resistance is demonstrated by patients experiencing similar overall survival for chemotherapy

inflammatory and protumorigenicpathways [] figure 2b broadly these stat3regulated genes can be categorised into pathways associatedwith inhibition of apoptosis increased cell proliferation modulation of immunity and inflammation increased angiogenesis and increased invasive and metastatic potential []although jakstat signalling is the predominant pathway activated downstream of il6 family cytokines themitogenactivated protein kinase mapk and phosphoinositide 3kinase pi3k pathways can also be activated  the mapk pathway has been suggested to be activated by a src homology domain 2containing phosphatase shp2mediated mechanism whereby shp2 is recruited to py759 on gp130 allowing jakmediated phosphorylation of shp2   this promotes association with the adaptor protein growth factor receptor bound protein grb2 leading to activation of the gprotein ras via son of sevenless sos with a subsequent phosphorylationcascade including raf mek and erk12 activity   following this a mapkdependent phosphorylationevent leads to the recruitment of grb2associated binding protein  gab1 to the plasma membrane where gab1 issuggested to act as a scaffold or adaptor protein to allow binding of pi3k and shp2 leading to activation of the pi3kand mapk pathways respectively   figure 2bthe suppressor of cytokine signalling  socs3 is largely responsible for regulation of signalling and is directlyupregulated by stat3   socs3 contains an sh2 domain allowing it to bind to py residues within the gp130receptor   with preferential binding to y759   once bound socs3 recruits an e3 ubiquitin ligasecomplex containing cullin5 rbx2 and adaptors elongin b and c via its socs box domain   this complexubiquitinates the gp130 receptor inducing its internalisation and targeting it for proteasomal degradation []and is also able to ubiquitinate jak2 in vitro   socs3 also mediates direct inhibition of the kinase activityof jak12 via its kinase inhibitory region [] thus socs3 is able to downregulate il6 family cytokinesignalling pathways through two distinct mechanismsthe phosphotyrosine phosphatases ptps and protein inhibitors of activated stats piass also limit the strengthand duration of cytokine signalling   a range of ptps including shp2 are responsible for dephosphorylatingtyrosine phosphorylated substrates including jaks stats and other shp2 molecules   pias3 preferentially binds pstat3 and inhibits activity either by preventing stat3 interaction with dna by recruiting transcriptional repressors to stat3 target genes or by sumoylating stat3 to prevent its activity   figure 2binterleukin  in pdacelevation of serum il6 is a negative prognostic marker in human pdacserum il6 levels were increased in pdac patients compared with healthy patients [] or those withchronic pancreatitis   and were also increased in patients with metastatic pdac compared to thosewith locally advanced disease [] moreover elevated serum il6 positively correlated with increased diseaseburden weight losscachexia and metastasis [] however there are conflicting observations inthe literature regarding il6 and cachexia   although increased serum il6 levels correlate with increased disease stage and in metastatic patients correlates with poor overall survival   as such it has been suggestedthat il6 may be a superior marker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes compared with the standard creactiveprotein crp carcinoembryonic antigen cea and carbohydrate antigen  ca199 markers  il6 is expressed within the tmell6il6 was overexpressed in human pdac tumours in

contributions of individual cell populations to disease outcome howeverit remains a widely used resource for exploratory investigations however overexpression of il6 has been observedat the mrna and protein level in the pancreata of pdac mice   with il6 expression increasing with agewhich is indicative of disease stage in these models  despite the presence of il6 in tumours primary human and commercial pancreatic cancer cell lines have been reported to exhibit variable expression levels of il6 and secreted cytokine albeit consistently higher than normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells

the icaf phenotype including activation ofthe jakstat signalling pathway and il6 production  in addition tams have been identified as producers of il6 in pancreatic cancer by correlative immunohistochemistry and expression analysis of isolated cell populations   production of il6 by tams was shownto influence tumour development via bonemarrow chimeras as mice reconstituted with il6 knockout ko il6myeloid cells developed lowgrade panins whilst those reconstituted with il6 wt cells developed panin3 lesions il6 is a driver of pdac pathogenesisboth in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the presence of il6 in the tme can drive activation of stat3  with il6 inhibition reducing stat3 phosphorylation   this il6stat3 program has been proposed tobe a driver of pdac pathogenesis by enhancing tumour initiation and progression angiogenesis regulation of cytokine expression and immune cell behaviour resistance to apoptosis and promotion of metastasis [] in aninducible krasdriven mouse model genetic deletion of il6 resulted in a reduction of adm and panin formationwhen kras mutation was initiated embryonically compared with controls suggesting a role for il6 in tumour initiation   this was also observed in a constitutive kras mutant model where genetic deletion of il6 preventedtumour initiation in vivo with a reduction in the number of panin   and  lesions   interestingly oncogenickras and hypoxic conditions both features of pdac tumours   were shown to induce il6 production  perhaps representing a feedforward pathway enhancing tumorigenesis   however il6 is notabsolutely required for panin formation as induction of kras mutation at  weeks of age in conjunction with anexperimental pancreatitis model drove formation of panin lesions that were not significantly different between il6wt and ko mice  il6 mice exhibited reduced tumour progression with decreased proliferative capacity of both cancer and stromal cells enabling regression of precursor lesions   furthermore this inhibition of tumour progression by il6deletion was due at least in part to the reversal of adm with ductal cells reverting to an acinarlike phenotype  increased apoptosis of cancer and stromal cells was also shown to contribute to this reduced tumour progression as demonstrated by appropriate immunohistochemical analyses with upregulation of proapoptotic anddownregulation of antiapoptotic bcl2 family members   this is mirrored by in vitro data whereby il6 stimulation increased the expression of antiapoptotic bcl2bcl2 and bcl2l1bclxl   with blockade of il6signalling or stat3 activation inducing apoptosis   collectively these data suggest that whilst il6 contributes it is not required for pdac initiation and progressionthe process of angiogenesis supports tumour growth and progression by enabling adequate blood supply whichis enhanced by il6 signalling upon il6 stimulation pdac cell lines upregulate key angiogenic factors such asvascular endothelial growth factor vegfvegf and neurophilin1 nrp1nrp1   with significant correlation observed between the expression of il6r and vegf on human pdac sections   il6inducedupregulation of vegf correlated with a growth advantage in pccs with both features inhibited by treatment witha jak2 inhibitor  another facet of the protumorigenic effects of il6 is the regulation of cytokine expression that enables modulationof the immune system   in particular it has been shown that il6 is able to upregulate a type  cytokine profile invitro that may inhibit antitumour immunity in disease   il6 suppressed the differentiation of human cd14cells into dendritic cells dcs in vitro whilst combination treatment with il6 and granulocyte colonystimulatingfactor gcsf inhibited the ability of dcs to respond to alloantigen a process that is required for dc maturationand antigen presentation where these effects were reversed by blockade of il6 andor gcsf   il6 has alsobeen implicated in driving increased apoptosis of type i conventional dcs cdc1s leading to cdc1 dysfunctionearly in tumorigenesis and thereby decreased cd8 tcell activation   this notion is further supported by invivo studies whereby genetic deletion of il6 in a krasdriven pdac mouse model exhibited a significant decreasein the percentage of intratumoral cancerpromoting macrophages and mdscs   utilising primary human pscsmdsc differentiation was shown to be driven by pscderived il6 in a stat3dependent manner   the resultantmdscs were able to suppress tcell proliferation   suggesting a role for il6 in promoting an immunosuppressivetme correlative analysis indicates that il6 through the generation of metabolic stress indirectly causes a reductionin the percentage of intratumoral natural killer nk cells cd4 and cd8 tcells in precachectic and cachecticmice   this effect was coupled to a reduction in the expression of an array of genes involved in immune cell  the authors this is an open access  published by

p005contributes to glioma progression through mir765nutf2 pathwaydiscussionas the most malignant brain tumor glioma leads to a huge number  of  deaths  patients  with  glioma  display  a  poor prognosis  therefore  it  is  of  great  significance  to  reveal the  mechanism  underlying  glioma  progression  in  this study  we  found  that  linc00173  was  upregulated  in glioma tissues and cells linc00173 overexpression predicted  a  poor  prognosis  moreover  linc00173  knockdown the  proliferation  migration  and invasion  of  glioma  cells  linc00173  was  also  found  to inhibit  mir765  and  promote  nutf2  expression summarily  our  research  discovered  that  linc00173  is an important oncogenic lncrna in gliomasuppressed the  potential  roles  of  lncrna  in  glioma  have  been researched  for  a  long  time  many  lncrnas  have  been identified to participate in glioma development for example lncrna  nck1as1  enhances  growth  and  metastasis  of glioma  through  targeting  mir13823p  to  activate  Î² catenin signaling2  lncrna ccat2 contributes to glioma progression  by  activating  vegfa  pathway15  lncrna linc00467  upregulation  promotes  glioma  development through repressing p53 level16 previous study showed that linc00173  downregulation  promotes  nonsmall  cell  lung cancer cell growth and survival17  however another study showed that linc00173 enhances chemoresistance and facilitates tumor progression in small cell lung cancer13 besides linc00173 contributes to breast cancer development14 yet how linc00173 works in glioma remains undermined in our  study  we  found  that  linc00173  was  upregulated  in glioma tissues linc00173 knockdown inhibited the proliferation migration and invasion of glioma cells therefore our data discovered that linc00173 is a new oncogene in glioma for the first timecancer management and research                                                                                submit your

mirnas such as mir4903p and mir2181314 in  our  study  we  did  not  observe  linc00173  sponges above  mirnas  however  through  bioinformatics  we identified  linc00173  targeted  mir765  in  glioma  we demonstrated  their  direct  interaction  and  found  that linc00173 overexpression inhibited mir765 expression mir765  has  important  roles  in  cancers  mir765  was found  to  suppress  tongue  squamous  cell  carcinoma development20  mir765  also  promotes  myeloma  and osteosarcoma  progression2122  besides  mir765  plays oncogenic or anticancer roles in gastric cancer and breast

nutf2 in glioma moreover we showed that nutf2 expression was regulated by linc00173mir   axis  the  function  of  nutf2  in  cancer  is  nearly unknown  in  our  work  we  found  that  nutf2  expression was  upregulated  in  glioma  tissues  compared  to  normal tissues  moreover  we  found  that  nutf2  overexpression promoted the proliferation migration and invasion of glioma cells indicating nutf2 was an oncogene in gliomain conclusion our study showed that linc00173 acted as  a  sponge  for  mir765  to  promote  nutf2 expression and  linc00173mir765nutf2  axis  plays  a

preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity  for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ ] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity  evenfor subcentimeter lesions  [] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented

accuracy ofDiscussionThe purpose of the DIAPANC trial is to investigate thediagnosticcontrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI in patients with suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A

pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore DIAPANC will contribute to our knowledge ofliver metastases regarding incidence

oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   ] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  ] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence osteosarcoma remains unclear Finally inthe training cohort  and  DEGs were identified asOS and DFSrelated DEGs respectively However onlyfive OS and five DFSrelated genes were identified in thevalidation cohort The different age structures smaller 0cHu  BMC Cancer

characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFÎ±induced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples

expression in the prostate cancer cells and RWPE1 cells was evaluated by qRTPCRConsequently higher level of LINC00992 was exhibitedin prostate cancer cells than that in RWPE1 cells Fig1b which was completely consistent with the result presented in previous discovery [] Particularly DU145and PC3 cells expressed the highest level of LINC00992and was thereby chosen for the later assays For

furtherverified the abundance of LINC00992 in the cytoplasmof prostate cancer cells Fig 2bc highlighting a posttranscriptional control of LINC00992 in such cellsHence we speculated that LINC00992 might act as aceRNA in prostate cancer regulation According toDIANAlncBase the top three potential miRNAs possessing the binding capacity with LINC00992 were listedFig 2d To targetthe highlymatched miRNA toLINC00992 qRTPCR analysis was conducted to testthe expression changes of these miRNAs following eitherLINC00992 depletion or augmentation The resultsdemonstrated that only miR3935 expression was increased by LINC00992 depletion Fig 2e but reducedby LINC00992 overexpression in the meantime Fig 2fThus miR3935 was chosen for further analysis Afterwards RNA pull down assay was implemented and theresult depicted that LINC00992 was pulled down byBiomiR3935WT Fig 2g which indicated the bindingof LINC00992 and miR3935 Later we observed thesatisfactory efficiency of miR3935 overexpression

the expression of GOLM1 a targetof miR3935Present evidence has suggested that miRNAs can bindwith downstream target genes to inhibit their expressionHerein we searched the miR3935 target genes andeight mRNAs were found out Subsequently we detectedtheir expression in prostate cancer cells and normalcells Interestingly we found that only Golgi membraneprotein  GOLM1 was highly expressed in four prostate cancer cell lines relative to normal controls Fig 3aFurther we discovered that GOLM1 expression wasmarkedly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues according to data from GEPIA database Fig 3b SimilarlyGOLM1 expression was much higher in prostate cancertissue samples than in peritumor samples Figure S3AIn addition the mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in contrastto RWPE1 cells Fig 3c Figure S3B Besides GOLM1has been previously revealed as a prostate cancer facilitator and was metastasisrelated in prostate tumor [] Thus we hypothesized that GOLM1 might act asthe downstream of LINC00992miR3935 signaling inprostate cancer Through TargetScan httpwwwtargetscanvert_72 the binding site between GOLM1and miR3935 was predicted Fig 3d After conductingluciferase reporter assay in DU145 and PC3 cells weobserved that upregulation of miR3935 specifically decreased the luciferase activity of GOLM1WT reporterFig 3e confirming the interaction between miR3935and GOLM1 relied on the putative binding sites Thenwe unveiled that GOLM1 mRNA and protein levels wereboth reduced by LINC00992 inhibition or miR3935upregulation according to qRTPCR and western blotanalyses Fig 3fg Figure S3C Moreover data fromRIP assay unveiled the binding of miR3935 to GOLM1in the RISCs Fig 3h Further we demonstrated thatthe decreased mRNA and protein levels of

subjects found null associations of vitamin D supplements with cesarean section []Much heterogeneity exists in the previous evidence inthis field and there may be several factors that partly explain these differences First most of the randomized trials included had a small sample size and were of lowquality Most subjects included in the trials had sufficient vitamin D status ¥ nmolL and a

Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ¥  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin

years the incidence of primary malignant brain tumors has increased at an annual rate of  with an especially higher rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years  years  years  yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers

clearly indicate thatthecharacteristics and outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood GBMFig  The glioma heatmap of 10gene signatures by gene expression subtype Representative genes are shown for each subtype a Heatmap ofpediatric

histologically similar adult tumor[] In addition the prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were  years old pediatric groupand  years old youth group  years oldmiddleaged group and ¥  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged  years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety

about the characteristics ofdementia caregivers sleep and the factors that may influence sleep disruptionThe purpose of this study was to investigate the sleep characteristics and disturbances of Australian caregivers of aperson living with dementia In addition it evaluated the psychological wellbeing of caregivers by evaluatingassociations between mood and sleep in this populationMethods This study used a crosssectional descriptive correlation design Participants were recruited with theassistance of Alzheimers Australia Dementia Australia and targeted social media advertising In total  adultprimary informal caregivers of people with dementia participated completing a questionnaire on demographiccharacteristics the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale DASS21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQIResults In this study  of caregivers were female who had been caring for someone living with dementia onaverage for  years  of participants had two or more comorbidities namely cardiovascular disease osteoarthritisand diabetes  of participants were poor sleepers with  with difficulty initiating sleep and  reporting havingdifficulty maintaining sleep Overall psychological distress was common with high levels of moderate to severedepression anxiety and stress Global PSQI scores were significantly positively associated with depression and anxietywith the strongest correlation seen with stress scores Depression scores were also moderately associated with daytimedysfunction Stress was identified as a significant predictor of overall sleep qualityConclusions Sleep problems are common within the population of dementia caregivers Due to the nature andduration of caregiving and the progression of dementia of the care recipient there is the potential for a decline in thecaregivers mental and physical health Caregivers of those living with dementia are more likely to have comorbiditiesdepression anxiety and stress Sleep quality is correlated with emotional distress in dementia caregivers although thedirection of this association is unclear Therefore sleep and psychological wellbeing may be intertwined withimprovements in one aspect resulting in a

LewyBody dementia Korsakoff syndrome alcohol related braininjury and younger onset dementia [] Globally thenumber of individuals with a formal dementia diagnosisrose from  million in  to  million in  []A further  million new cases of dementia worldwideare predicted each year [] as populations around theglobe continue to live longer [] These figures could bevery much under estimated as it is widely accepted thatbetween  and  of people affected have no formaldementia diagnosis [] This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults ¥ years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregivers own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the

providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent

the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure

worldwide it is estimated at  millionyear by  representing anincrease of  in cases compared with  [] Theincidence of cancer is  times higher in people over years old and people aged  and older have a higherrisk of developing invasive cancer []The older population is characterized by a very heterogeneous profile especially in terms of frailty geriatriccharacteristics and comorbidities which explains theneed for specific and adapted care [ ] Neverthelessscientific data are scarce because older subjects are oftenunderrepresented in oncological clinical trials that setthe standards of antineoplastic treatment [ ]Over the last three decades the fiveyear survival ratefor all types of cancer has increased particularly in individuals aged  to  [ ] Still older patients are atmore risk of toxicity in anticancer therapies such aschemotherapy and require a benefitrisk assessmentprior to treatment [] A comprehensive geriatric assessment CGA is consequently recommended in these patients to diagnose comorbidities and optimize geriatricinterventions and to improve the functional state andpossibly the survival rate by ensuring better tolerance totreatment [ ] CGA has also shown predictive valuein identifying elderly patients with cancer who are exposed to a poor prognosisincluding a higher risk ofdeath during hospitalization [] Among the CGAbased assessment tools the

interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter and collaborators reported independent associations betweenoneyear mortality in multivariable analysis and risk factors including male

to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworlds older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged ¥ yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV  two algorithms which determine an individualscurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between

concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than    CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed    CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than    CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less

accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  ] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were

rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious

patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that  of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated

dissatisfaction delayed discharge and unanticipated hospital admission after ambulatory surgery[] Both delayed discharge and unanticipated hospitaladmission have the undesirable effect ofincreasinghealthcare costs [] In the postoperative period moderate to severe pain are frequently observed during thefirst  to  h after ambulatory surgery []hassurgerysignificantlyPatient recovery after ambulatory surgery has improvedsince the introduction of the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery a multimodal perioperative care pathwaydesigned to achieve early recovery after surgery []Ambulatoryshortenedhospitalization accelerated turnover and reduced hospitalcosts and rates of nosocomial infections [] However theshortened hospitalization and increased mobility of surgical patients have necessitated the need to improve theefficacy of anesthesia and perioperative managementTherefore postoperative pain and the complicationsarising from its treatment are important considerationsfor patients undergoing ambulatory surgeryVarious drugs have been used to prolong postoperativeanalgesia such as tramadol [] ketorolac [] dexmedetomidine [] ketamine [] and nalbuphine [] Nalbuphine a synthetic opioid agonistantagonist analgesic isprimarily a kappa Îº agonist and a partial mu Î¼ antagonist It has a better safety profile with fewer side effectscompared with other opioids because of its agonist andantagonist activities [] Nalbuphine [] exerts its analgesic and hypnotic effects through its Îº opioid receptorwhich may reduce Î¼ opioid receptorrelated adverseevents Numerous studies [ ] have reported its advantages in pain managementThere have been few studies in China of nalbuphinefor the treatment of postoperative pain after ambulatorysurgery The

isstatistically significant compared with T0pain which is the main cause of readmission after daysurgery []According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder Î¼ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration ofnalbuphine for pain relief after ambulatory surgery waslonger than that of tramadol There were  cases of adverse reactions in the nalbuphine group which wasnot significantly different from the  cases  in thetramadol groupThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with nalbuphine is relatively low compared with other opioidmedications A metaanalysis of randomized controlledtrials by Zeng  [] showed that nalbuphine hassimilar analgesic effects compared to morphine and abetter drug safety profile with a low incidence of postoperative pruritusrespiratory inhibition nausea andvomiting In addition studies have reported that antagonism of the Î¼ receptor by nalbuphine could reduce theadverse reactions of other opioids as seen in the combination of morphine and nalbuphine in patientcontrolled analgesia or patientcontrolled epidural analgesia [ ] and the rate of adverse effects such asurinary retention related to morphine pruritus and nausea was significantly less Nalbuphine with sufentanilused in patientcontrolled analgesia could reduce the 0cGuan  BMC Anesthesiology            Page  of incidence of opioidrelated nausea and vomiting and improved patients satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory surgeryAcknowledgementsNot applicableAuthors contributionsGYJ This author contributed to the data

              "\"Early detection of capecitabineresistance could largely increase overall survival of colorectal cancerCRC patients Previous studies suggested examination of immune cells in peripheral blood would help to predictefficacy of chemotherapyMethods We examined the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood in CRC patients with capecitabinetreatment We analyzed the relationships between the abnormal immune cell population in capecitabineresistancepatients and major clinical features Furthermore RNA sequencing analyses of cell surface marker expression andthe correlations with other major immune cell populations were performed using this population to explore thepossible function of these cellsResults The expression level of CD16 on neutrophils was downregulated in

appeared much earlier than CT scan RNA sequencing revealedthat CD16lowneutrophils in capecitabineresistant patients had lower expression level of neutrophilrelated genescompared to CD16neutrophils in capecitabinesensitive patients suggesting this CD16lowpopulation might beimmature neutrophils Furthermore the expression level of CD16 on neutrophils in patients with capecitabinetreatment was

[] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhats more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are

counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy []Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFNÎ productionby tumorspecific CD8T

healthCapecitabine the oral form of 5FU which is widelyused in CRC therapy has only modest efficacy due tothe chemoresistance Great efforts have been taken tofind out the mechanism Previous studies mainly concentrated on tumor cells themselves such as expressionof specific genes or generation of particular tumor cells[ ] In this research we worked on the correlationbetween changes on immune system and capecitabinechemoresistance and illustrated the conversion fromneutrophilsto immunosuppressive PMNMDSClikeneutrophils in these capecitabine insensitive patients byRNA sequencing and flow cytometry Our conclusioncould also be supported by other studies that 5FUcould promote MDSC protumor function The study byBruchard M  found that 5FU could activate NLRP3inflammasome in MDSC and promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell infiltration in CRC tumor tissue represented favorable prognosis [] and by using in vitro studies these studiesalso demonstrated that colon cancer infiltrate neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroups data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16lowmyeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity FcÎ receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target

NCD around the world about  of the patients who have diabetes sufferfrom Type  DM T2DM [] The risk of developing T2DM is strongly associated withmany predispositions behavioral and environmental risk factors and also genetic factors [] Besides the genetic factors strong evidence indicates that factors such asobesity and physical inactivity are the main nongenetic determinants of the disease [] T2DM can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to dominant defective secretion with insulin resistance [] It is often related tometabolic syndrome problems Individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance arehighrisk subjects of type  diabetes []Studies demonstrate a drastic increase of the disease in recent decades The trendsestimate that by  more than  million people will be affected by the disease []People who suffer from T2DM are susceptible to many forms of complications leadingto morbidity and mortality in these patients Many studies emphasize the genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM [  ] Long noncoding RNAs long ncRNAslncRNA are subsets of RNA specified as being transcripts with lengths exceeding nucleotides that could not be translated into protein [] Long noncoding RNAslncRNAs belong to a heterogeneous class of regulatory lncRNAs with transcriptlengths   nucleotides which have a positive role in the development and growth ofseveral various diseases including T2DM supporting the hypothesis that abnormal expression of LncRNAs is related to various diseases [] Besides considering the significant role of lncRNAs in disease pathogenesis increasing researches suggest using themto improve diagnosis prognosis and clinical management of T2DM Genomewide association studies GWAS have recently introduced several particular diabetesrelatedloci in the human genome [] Also many studies discovered the relationship betweenmore than  susceptible loci and T2DM at a genomewide significant level [  ]Deregulation of genes located in GWAS defined loci may be risk factors for human diseases concerning which we applied the GWAS catalog to select six lncRNAsLINC00523 LINC00995 CG27_201 TPT1AS1LY86AS1 DKFZP as our gene targets for the present study [] Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD or data miningare techniques for the computational process of discovering patterns in large datasetscontaining various

Inour study we combined six lncRNAs as variables for the first time and appliedfour classification models including classification algorithms like Knearest neighbor KNN support vector machine SVM logistic regression and artificial neuralnetworks ANN for diagnosing T2DM and we compared the diagnostic power ofthese algorithms with each other In the present study we aimed to find the bestdata mining approach for the prediction of T2DM using six lncRNA expressionThe result of this study could improve our knowledge about the early detectionand diagnosis of T2DM using the lncRNAs as biomarkers []MethodsThe primary aim of the present study was to implement four models to predict DT2Mapplying data mining techniques based on the lncRNA variables The research objectives of our study wereImplementing data mining techniques for prediction of the DT2M Comparing the applied methodsselecting the best model for the T2DM prediction 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of We used the variables for predicting T2DM and comparing the performance of thevarious data mining techniques For the implementation of the algorithms we usedANACONDA3  bit a free and  source platform distribution of pythonprogramming language with a vast number of modules packages and rich libraries thatprovide various methods for classification problems For obtaining the best amount ofperformance in the models 10fold crossvalidation performed on the dataset In dealing with the small data sets crossvalidation is a prominent strategy for estimating theperformance CrossValidation is a performance evaluation technique commonly usedin practice Here the data set is repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbors algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem []Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in Fig It maps a set of input data into a set of appropriate output classes It includes threelayers input layer hidden layer  output layer The principal function of neurons of the 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of Fig  Artificial Neural Network structureinput layer is to divide input Xi into neurons in the hidden layer The neuron of thehidden layer adds the appropriate weights of Wij to the input variables The output formula isYj ¼ fWji XiX 10 11Where f is a simple threshold function that we considered sigmoid and hyperbolictangent function []In the present study a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN was performed The structure of MLPNN is as shown in Fig  It makes a map of input dataonto a set of suitable output dataThe RBF networks are another type of neural network In MLP each neuron considers the weighted sum of its input values in which each input value is multiplied by acoefficient and the results are the sum of values RBF is a more intuitive approach toMLP An RBFN classifies the inputs by calculating the inputs similarity to examplesfrom the training set Each RBFN neuron stores one of the examples from the trainingset as a prototype for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability

normalizedthe data inputs for KNN SVM and ANN models We also had low missing variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human Î²cell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility loci have been identified as being associated with T2DM at a genomewidesignificant level [ ] Considering this into account and by querying the GWAS catalog we candidated  lncRNAs LY86AS1 HCG27_201 LINC00523 LINC00994TPT1AS1and DKFZP as target genes for this studyThe large scale GWAS have recognized approximately  SNPs that were susceptibleto T2DM [] From there we used the GWAS catalog access in June  to create alist of SNPs associated with T2DM In the current study we selected six lncRNA forexpression analysis

this research we optimized the parameters of every algorithm and used stratified 10fold crossvalidation togain the best performance To be mentioned in the nearest neighbors algorithm theparameter k

the strong points ofour study are using demographic data and six Long noncoding RNAs and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher

suitable which couldhelp in the diagnosis of prediabetes and T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and

functions of the genes that map to copy number variable regionsResults  Using a dataset that comprised  MurcianoGranadina goats genotyped with the Goat SNP50 BeadChip we were able to detect  and  autosomal CNV with the PennCNV and QuantiSNP software respectively By applying the EnsembleCNV algorithm these CNV were assembled into  CNV regions CNVR of which   of the total CNVR count were consistently called by PennCNV and QuantiSNP and used in subsequent analyses In this set of  CNVR we identified  gain  loss and  gainloss events The total length of all the CNVR  Mb represented  of the goat autosomal genome  Mb whereas their size ranged from  kb to  Mb with an average size of  kb Functional annotation of the genes that overlapped with the CNVR revealed an enrichment of pathways related with olfactory transduction foldenrichment   qvalue     ABC transporters foldenrichment   qvalue     and bile secretion foldenrichment   qvalue    Conclusions  A previous study reported that the average number of CNVR per goat breed was    CNVR50 breeds which is much smaller than the number we found here  CNVR We attribute this difference to the fact that the previous study included multiple caprine breeds that were represented by small to moderate numbers of individuals Given the low frequencies of CNV in our study the average frequency of CNV is  such a design would probably underestimate the levels of the diversity of CNV at the withinbreed level We also observed that functions related with sensory perception metabolism and embryo development are overrepresented in the set of genes that overlapped with CNV and that these loci often belong to large multigene families with tens hundreds or thousands of paralogous members a feature that could

caused  by  the segregation of CNV Genome scans to detect structural variations  in  cattle  have  revealed  that  CNV  regions CNVR are often enriched in genes that are involved in immunity [] metabolism [ ] embryo development [ ] and sensory perception [ ] There is evidence that the  dNdS ratios of genes that map to taurine CNV are generally higher than those of genes that do not overlap with CNV which indicates that CNV genes probably evolve under reduced selective constraint [] The analysis of gene networks has also shown that genes that  colocalize  with  duplications  tend  to  have  fewer interactions with other genes than loci that do not overlap  with  CNV  reinforcing  the  idea  that  genes  mapping to duplicated regions have fewer essential housekeeping functions  than  nonCNV  genes  and  also  have  reduced pleiotropy []Although structural chromosomal variations can have strong  effects  on  gene  expression  and  phenotypic  variability  technical  limitations  and  the  moderate  quality of genome assemblies have hampered CNV mapping in livestock  []  Until  recently  this  has  been  particularly true for goats In  Fontanesi et a0al [] published the first  caprine  CNV  map  by  identifying  with  the  Bovine a0k aCGH array  CNVR including  and  copy loss and gain variants respectively Later on resequencing  the  genome  of  individuals  from  several  caprine breeds  made  it  possible  to  identify  CNV  that  overlap with  pigmentation genes and to detect an association between increased ASIP copy number and light pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic

[] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a

BeadChip analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term sensory perception was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms olfactory transduction  fold  enrichment    and  Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that sensory perception of smell and Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that sensory perceptions of smell and chemical  stimuli  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the sensory perception functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  []  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  []  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [  ] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   ]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take  a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions  JR TR SS JM design acquisition of data data analysis  interpretation

factors forosteoporosisSome studies about the influence of sex on osteoporosis remain controversial In our study there was a significant relationship between H pylori and osteoporosisin premenopausal females but not in males The reasonsfor the difference between males and females are asfollows First differences in clinical outcomes of osteoporosis in men and women may be rooted in the biologic properties of bone BarrettConnor E holds theview that there are sexspecific differences in the number of osteoprogenitor cells and in hormone responsesand regulation [ ] Second men have a greater bonesize trabecular BMD and bone area at the radius andtibia than women even after adjusting for weight andheight which may lead to a decrease in osteoporosis andfracture [] Third men undergo a slow decrease inBMD with increasing age while women experience aprofound period of rapid bone resorption especiallyafter entering menopause [] Last but not least somestudies support the idea that men are more likely to suffer from secondary diseasefor example rheumatoidarthritis alcoholism excessive smoking gonadal deficiencies and others [] which may lead to sustainablebone lossUnfortunately the relationship between osteoporosisand H pylori infection is still controversial Some studieshold the view that there is no difference between menand women in the relationship between H pylori andosteoporosis [ ] Some studies hold the view that Hpylori is related to osteoporosis only in women ShihChun Lin conducted a retrospective study including women and showed that H pylori is related to osteoporosis in females [] while others think that there is nocorrelation between them in females Daisuke Chindaconducted a study of  healthy women and found thatH pylori is not a significant risk factor for oste ia[] In our study we analysed the relationship betweenH pylori infection and osteoporosis We found a significant relationship between H pylori infection status andbone density in premenopausal females but not in malesWe suspect this may be due to the difference in the aetiology of osteoporosis between males and females However we did not find any other studies on this and itrequires more systematic research for analysisAfter analysing the differences between males and females we found that there were significant differencesin BMI WHR and TG in the study population Thisstudy provides evidence for followup research on sexdifferences in the relationship between H pylori andosteoporosisMost studies hold the view that obesity is related toosteoporosis [] It is generally believed that obesitymay be a protective factor against bone loss and osteoporosis [] However the effect of obesity remains unclear On the one hand obesity has traditionally beenconsidered positive for bone because of the beneficial effect of mechanicalloading [] On the other handpeople hold the view that BMI may harm BMD Osteoblasts and adipocytes both stem from marrow mesenchymal

pylori infection is associated with a decrease in bone density The possible reasons are as follows First H pylori infection may causesystemic inflammation and increase the production oftumour necrosis factorÎ± interleukin1 and interleukin [] These cytokines are directly involved in the reduction of BMD We found that HCY is related toosteoporosis which supports this hypothesis Secondosteoporosis may be related to a decrease in vitamin B12levels [] Serin et als study examined  patientswithout atrophy erosions or ulcers and they found thatthe histopathological scores for both antral and corpusH pylori density and inflammation were significantly inversely associated with serum vitamin B12 levels [] Inour study although we did not find a significant relationship between B12 and osteoporosis we still supportthe relevant theory The absence of our results may bedue to a lack of sufficient data and the influence of confounding factors Last but notleast most patientschronically infected with H pylori manifest pangastritiswith reduced acid secretion due to bacterial virulencefactors inflammatory cytokines and various degrees ofgastric atrophy [] Calcium is ionized in acidic conditions and absorbed in the small bowel Therefore in either hypochlorhydria or achlorhydric stomachs calciumabsorption is impaired [] Moreover the longtermuse of acid suppressants for example proton pump inhibitors may lead to osteoporosis or a decrease in BMDLimited experimental evidence indicates that PPI mayinfluence calcium absorption leading to compensatoryphysiologic responsesincluding secondary hyperparathyroidism which may cause an increase in the rate ofosteoclastic bone resorption [] The results showedthat calcium had a trend though it was not statisticallysignificant P   with osteoporosis Our results donot support the theory that there is a correlation between Ca and osteoporosis but it may be that Helicobacter pyloriinfection may cause calcium absorptiondamage and affect BMD We did not analyse vitamin Dlevels which could affect both bone homeostasis and theinflammatory state [] Although H pyloriinfectioncausing a decrease in bone density is supported by

miR2861 decreased the expression levels of AKT2 and downregulation of SNHG14 reduced the expression of AKT2Fig 6c and dDiscussionsOsteoblastic differentiation from hMSCs many originates from many cell events that are affected by variousmolecular and cellular procedures during the development of bone and skeleton It is crucial to reveal important factors that mediate this phenomenon and to studythe underlying mechanisms Owing to the successfulfindings from the previous studies different lncRNAshave been shown to participate in the osteoblast differentiation by targeting corresponding cell

miR675[]Various lncRNAs and miRNAs are dysregulated during the hMSCs differentiation of osteoblast [ ] Inour study we found a similar phenomenon We firstlyanalyzed the expression of SNHG14 and miR2861 inserum and hMSCs of osteoporosis patients Comparedto nonosteoporosis participants the expression levels ofSNHG14 in serum and hMSCs of osteoporosis patientswere greatly elevated The expression of miR2861 wasdrastically downregulated in hMSCs of osteoporosisgroup A negative relationship was established betweenthe expression of SNHG14 and miR2861 in serum ofosteoporosis group Similar to previous studies we identified that lncRNA SNHG14 was upregulated but miR was downregulated in serum and hMSCs from patients with osteoporosisFig  AKT2 was targeted by miR2861 a Shared binding sequences

luciferase activities compared withthat of SNHG14 MUT Moreover shSNHG14 elevatedthe expression levels of miR2861 The relative expression levels of SNHG14 were also lowered in cells transfected with miR2861 As far as we know we are thefirst to reveal that SNHG14 is targeted by miR2861 during the hMSCs differentiation to osteoblastAccording to previous reports ALP is highly expressedin osteoblast which is an important indicator for maturedifferentiation of osteoblast [] Osteoblastspecific genesRUNX2 Osterix ALP and OC are also critical genes to indicate the existing of osteoblast [ ] To investigatethe effects of SNHG14 on hMSC osteoblast differentiation we induced hMSCs differentiation to osteoblastsafter transfection with shSNHG14 or shNC The expression of SNHG14 was suppressed in

predominant pancreaticmalignancypancreatic cancer can arise from either the endocrine or the exocrine region of the pancreas tumours arising fromthe exocrine compartment are termed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac and account for over  of allpancreatic cancers  pdac develops via a stepwise progression from normal tissue through to invasive lesions which is associated withdistinct morphological characteristics [] it has been proposed that this process begins with a phenomenontermed acinartoductal metaplasia adm which is a normal homeostatic mechanism whereby acinar cells transdifferentiate into a ductal phenotype in response to particular stimuli   however if compounded by an oncogenichit cells are pushed towards a pathogenic phenotype that develops into pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia panin[] disease progresses through preinvasive stages termed panin1a panin1b panin2 and panin3 priorto invasive pdac   this progression is associated with increasing nuclear atypia whereby the nuclei are no longerpositioned basally and loss of normal architecture as cells become more papillary in nature with panin3 lesionsdemonstrating increased mitoses   as disease progresses to pdac cells become invasive and breach the basement membrane growing through the extracellular matrix and metastasising to distant ans figure less common precursor lesions include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ipmns and mucinous cysticneoplasms mcns that also develop through multistep processes   whilst they share some common featureseach lesion is morphologically and genetically distinct in contrast with panins that form within small ducts ipmnsdevelop within the primary or secondary branches of the main pancreatic duct whilst mcns lack ductal involvement an ammatory tumour microenvironment contributes to pdacpathogenesisan archetypal feature of pdac is the development of extensive stromal networks within the tumour microenvironment tme that can account for up to  of the total tumour volume [] this unique characteristic drives theinflammatory nature of pdac that contributes to its aggressive phenotype   desmoplasia is driven by pancreaticstellate cells pscs and cancerassociated fibroblasts cafs that upon activation produce a range of extracellularmatrix ecm components such as collagen laminin and fibronectin which in turn form a physical barrier preventing the penetration of therapeutics [] though pscs and cafs have been shown to support cancer metastasis and drug resistance they interact with cancer cells in a bidirectional manner with each promoting the survivalgrowth and proliferation of the other [] quiescent fibroblasts are able to differentiate into two unique subtypes termed myofibroblastic cafs mycafs and inflammatory cafs icafs   these two subtypes are distinct whereby mycafs express high levels of Î±smooth muscle actin Î±sma and are located adjacent to cancercells while icafs express low levels of Î±sma and instead secrete high levels of inflammatory mediators including il6 and are distributed distant from cancer cells within desmoplastic tumour regions   broadly mycafsappear to have roles in epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt and ecm remodelling whilst icafs appear tobe involved in inflammation and ecm deposition   a third less abundant subtype termed antigenpresentingcafs apcafs has more recently been defined   these cells express low levels of both Î±sma and il6 andinstead express high levels of major histocompatibility complex class ii mhcii and related genes   as such allthree

cells regulatory tcells myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs dendriticcells natural killer nk cells and nerve cells   interactions between various cells within the tme can driveeither proor antitumorigenic functions of others for example cancer cells can induce pscs to secrete inflammatorycytokines that drive immune cells towards an immunosuppressive phenotype and also form a positive feedback loopby increasing the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells   the ecm itself has also been suggested to modifypsc behaviour in particular that ecm stiffness promotes the mycaf phenotype indicated by increased Î±smaexpression   this results in substantial complexity that ultimately determines tumour phenotype  the components of the microenvironment modify tumour behaviour through the production of cytokines growthfactors and other signalling molecules that predominantly drive a proinflammatory and immunosuppressive program that enhances pdac tumour growth and progression []

all three proteins are either directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of the g1s cellcycle checkpoint analysis of patient tumours indicates that two or more of these mutations often occur together withcdkn2a mutation being combined with either tp53 smad4 or both usually in the background of kras mutation   this suggests that by disrupting this checkpoint cancer cells are able to

to note that technical advances are continuously uncovering epigenetic mechanisms thatfurther modulate the pdac transcriptional landscape and ultimately influence disease heterogeneity and tumourprogression  molecular subtypesthe pdac epithelial compartment is typically divided into two subtypes including a classical subtype exhibiting anepitheliallike expression profile and a squamous or mesenchymallike subtype   an additional third exocrinesubtype is outlined in some analyses and is characterised by a gene expression profile related to digestive enzymeproduction   the classical or epithelial subtype has also been further divided into a pancreatic progenitor andan immunogenic subtype whereby the immunogenic subtype is distinguished by significant immune infiltration andassociated gene programmes   though there is no consensus on which classification system will allow the mostvaluable stratification of patients the mesenchymal subtype is invariably associated with a poor prognosis  the stromal compartment has also been classified into either normal or activated subtypes reflecting the proandantitumorigenic capabilities of the tme with the activated subtype associated with reduced survival   this isparticularly valuable as the extensive heterogeneity of pdac complicates clinically relevant stratification of patientsthus the identification of molecularly unique subtypes may enable development of tailored therapeutic regimensthat will provide improved clinical outcomescurrent treatment optionsregardless of disease stage at time of diagnosis patients

advances in chemotherapeutic options treatment efficacy and patient prognosis remain poor due to the inherent therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer it has been proposed that this drug resistance

diseaseburden weight losscachexia and metastasis [] however there are conflicting observations inthe literature regarding il6 and cachexia   although increased serum il6 levels correlate with increased disease stage and in metastatic patients correlates with poor overall survival   as such it has been suggestedthat il6 may be a superior marker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes

contributions of individual cell populations to disease outcome howeverit remains a widely used resource for exploratory investigations however overexpression of il6 has been observedat the mrna and

the icaf phenotype including activation ofthe jakstat signalling pathway and il6 production  in addition tams have been identified as producers of il6 in pancreatic cancer by correlative immunohistochemistry and expression analysis of isolated cell populations   production of il6 by tams was shownto influence tumour development via bonemarrow chimeras as mice reconstituted with il6 knockout ko il6myeloid cells developed lowgrade panins whilst those reconstituted with il6 wt cells developed panin3 lesions il6 is a driver of pdac pathogenesisboth in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the presence of il6 in the tme can drive activation of stat3  with il6 inhibition reducing stat3 phosphorylation   this il6stat3 program has been proposed tobe a driver of pdac pathogenesis by enhancing tumour initiation and progression angiogenesis regulation of cytokine expression and immune cell behaviour resistance to apoptosis and promotion of metastasis [] in aninducible krasdriven mouse model genetic deletion of il6 resulted in a reduction of adm and panin formationwhen kras mutation was initiated embryonically compared with controls suggesting a role for il6 in tumour initiation   this was also observed in a constitutive kras mutant model where genetic deletion of il6 preventedtumour initiation in vivo with a reduction in the number of panin   and  lesions   interestingly oncogenickras and hypoxic conditions both features of pdac tumours   were shown to induce il6 production  perhaps representing a feedforward pathway enhancing tumorigenesis   however il6 is notabsolutely required for panin formation as induction of kras mutation at  weeks of age in conjunction with anexperimental pancreatitis model drove formation of panin lesions that were not significantly different between il6wt and ko mice  il6 mice exhibited reduced tumour progression with decreased proliferative capacity of both cancer and stromal cells enabling regression of precursor lesions   furthermore this inhibition of tumour progression by il6deletion was due at least in part to the reversal of adm with ductal cells reverting to an acinarlike phenotype  increased apoptosis of cancer and stromal cells was also shown to contribute to this reduced tumour progression as demonstrated by appropriate immunohistochemical analyses with upregulation of proapoptotic anddownregulation of antiapoptotic bcl2 family members   this is mirrored by in vitro data whereby il6 stimulation increased the expression of antiapoptotic bcl2bcl2 and bcl2l1bclxl   with blockade of il6signalling or stat3 activation inducing apoptosis   collectively these data suggest that whilst il6 contributes it is not required for pdac initiation and progressionthe process of angiogenesis supports tumour growth and progression by enabling adequate blood supply whichis enhanced by il6 signalling upon il6 stimulation pdac cell lines upregulate key angiogenic factors such asvascular endothelial growth factor vegfvegf and neurophilin1 nrp1nrp1   with significant correlation observed between the expression of il6r and vegf on human pdac sections   il6inducedupregulation of vegf correlated with a growth advantage in pccs with both features inhibited by treatment witha jak2 inhibitor  another facet of the protumorigenic effects of il6 is the regulation of cytokine expression that enables modulationof the immune system   in particular it has been shown that il6 is able to upregulate a type  cytokine profile invitro that may inhibit antitumour immunity in disease   il6 suppressed the differentiation of human cd14cells into dendritic cells dcs in vitro whilst combination treatment with il6 and granulocyte colonystimulatingfactor gcsf inhibited the ability of dcs to respond to alloantigen a process that is required for dc maturationand antigen presentation where these effects were reversed by blockade of il6 andor gcsf   il6 has alsobeen implicated in driving increased apoptosis of type i conventional dcs cdc1s leading to cdc1 dysfunctionearly in tumorigenesis and thereby decreased cd8 tcell activation   this notion is further supported by invivo studies whereby genetic deletion of il6 in a krasdriven pdac mouse model exhibited a significant decreasein the percentage of intratumoral cancerpromoting macrophages and mdscs   utilising primary human pscsmdsc differentiation was shown to be driven by pscderived il6 in a stat3dependent manner   the resultantmdscs were able to suppress tcell proliferation   suggesting a role for il6 in promoting an immunosuppressivetme correlative analysis indicates that il6 through the generation of metabolic stress indirectly causes a reductionin the percentage of intratumoral natural killer nk cells cd4 and cd8 tcells in precachectic and cachecticmice   this effect was coupled to a reduction in the expression of an array of genes involved in immune cell  the authors this is an open access  published by

cancerrelated deaths before Developments in pancreatic cancer diagnosticssurgical techniques and treatment have hardly improvedthe survival rate in the past  years The 5year relativesurvival rate as reported by the American Cancer Societyremains only  [ ]Only  of all patients are eligible for surgery todate the only potential cure [] Approximately  ofall patients with pancreatic cancer have metastatic diseaseat diagnosis and  of all patients have locally advanceddisease with tumor involvement of surrounding vessels orans At the time of surgery approximately  ofthe patients are considered unresectable because of unexpected liver metastasis peritoneal carcinomatosis or locally advanced disease []More than  of all liver metastases develop in thefirst six months postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity  for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ ] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity  evenfor subcentimeter lesions  [] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is advised for all patients according to the Japanese guideline however the level of evidenceis low grade C []Most studies that have been performed for liver metasincluding our singletases of PDAC are retrospectivecenter study in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer without liver

CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore DIAPANC will contribute to our knowledge ofliver metastases regarding incidence imaging characteristics their number and extent and their change in timewith or without treatment When our hypothesis is confirmed it will enhance the worldwide implementation ofMRI and consequently

biomarkers in osteosarcomapatients and the relative potential mechanism mainly attributes to the regulation of downstream signaling pathwaysby sponging microRNA In addition lncRNA [] microRNA [] and

heterogeneity in humansTherefore it is necessary to find accurate biomarkers forosteosarcomaIn recent years researchers have paid more and moreattention to the role of the tumor microenvironmentTME in malignant tumors The function of TME inthe tumorigenesis progression and therapy of tumorshave been initially understood [ ] More importantly Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor

oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   ] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  ] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent

characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFÎ±induced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples

furtherverified the abundance of LINC00992 in the cytoplasmof prostate cancer cells Fig 2bc highlighting a posttranscriptional control of LINC00992 in such cellsHence we speculated that LINC00992 might act as aceRNA in prostate cancer regulation According toDIANAlncBase the top three potential miRNAs possessing the binding capacity with LINC00992 were listedFig 2d To targetthe highlymatched miRNA toLINC00992 qRTPCR analysis was conducted to testthe expression changes of these miRNAs following eitherLINC00992 depletion or augmentation The resultsdemonstrated that only miR3935 expression was increased by LINC00992 depletion Fig 2e but reducedby LINC00992 overexpression in the meantime Fig 2fThus miR3935 was chosen for further analysis Afterwards RNA pull down assay was implemented and theresult depicted that LINC00992 was pulled down byBiomiR3935WT Fig 2g which indicated the bindingof LINC00992 and miR3935 Later we observed thesatisfactory efficiency of miR3935 overexpression

andeight mRNAs were found out Subsequently we detectedtheir expression in prostate cancer cells and normalcells Interestingly we found that only Golgi membraneprotein  GOLM1 was highly expressed in four prostate cancer cell lines relative to normal controls Fig 3aFurther we discovered that GOLM1 expression wasmarkedly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues according to data from GEPIA database Fig 3b SimilarlyGOLM1 expression was much higher in prostate cancertissue samples than in peritumor samples Figure S3AIn addition the mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in contrastto RWPE1 cells Fig 3c Figure S3B Besides GOLM1has been previously revealed as a prostate cancer facilitator and was metastasisrelated in prostate tumor [] Thus we hypothesized that GOLM1 might act asthe downstream of LINC00992miR3935 signaling inprostate cancer Through TargetScan httpwwwtargetscanvert_72 the binding site between GOLM1and miR3935 was predicted Fig 3d After conductingluciferase reporter assay in DU145 and PC3 cells weobserved that upregulation of miR3935 specifically decreased the luciferase activity of GOLM1WT reporterFig 3e confirming the interaction between miR3935and GOLM1 relied on the putative binding sites Thenwe unveiled that GOLM1 mRNA and protein levels wereboth reduced by LINC00992 inhibition or miR3935upregulation according to qRTPCR and

the risk of low birthweight or preterm birth in a metaanalysis based on randomized trials [] these results were further supported byanother update study [] In addition higher 25OHDconcentrations were

the previous evidence inthis field and there may be several factors that partly explain these differences First most of the randomized trials included had a small sample size and were of lowquality

detrimental influence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the reference group [] Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ¥  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years  years  years  yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers Therefore there is an urgent needto establish a more appropriate age group classificationcriterion for

outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were  years old pediatric groupand  years old youth group  years oldmiddleaged group and ¥  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged  years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced

depressionanxiety and stress which were in keeping with previousliterature around caregiving and psychological distressMore than half of the caregivers surveyed reported symptoms of depression and stress  and  respectivelyand  reported anxiety These findings are in keepingwith that of a recent study of dementia caregivers in ruralVictoria where  of caregivers reported depression orstress and  reported anxiety []Previous work has identified an association betweendepression and poor sleep among dementia caregivers[ ] Reduced quality of sleep and depression arehigher among caregivers of people living with dementia[] Furthermore caregivers of people living withdementia who were also depressed experience a greatervariation in sleep patterns []This study reveals sleep scores were

gender comorbidities and length of care This isa novel finding and represents a potential therapeutictarget to improve sleep quality in dementia caregiversDespite the high prevalence of selfidentified poorsleep overnight respite was only used by  of participants which is in keeping with previous research thatcites  of Australian caregivers have never usedrespite services [] Access to respite care remains oneof the major means of easing caregiver burden and is 0cSmyth  BMC Geriatrics            Page  of frequently identified as needed by caregivers yet remainsunderutilised Whilst a high proportion of dementiacaregivers report a need for respite services there isinsufficient awareness of and access to respite servicesfor caregivers [] Respite service availability can beinvaluable with caregivers reporting lower stress levelsand improved health after use [] Sleep disturbanceshave also been shown to be partially reversed for caregiversduring periods of respite care [] perhaps due to reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent chronic disease in the dementia caregiver groupwhich is in keeping with our findings []Managing sleep and its associated mediators will havedirect impact on both the caregivers own health as wellas the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure optimalcaregivercare recipient relationship supporting the personliving with dementia to remain at home as long as possibleAbbreviationsDASS21 Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale21 PLWD

Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter

multiplemeasures selfreport and medicationbased measures of morbidity to fully capture accurate prevalence estimates of multimorbidity Our study identified several limitations of thecurrent versions of the RxRisk indices which require updating if medicationbased measures ofmorbidity are to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworlds older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged ¥ yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV  two algorithms which determine an individualscurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk

concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than    CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed    CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than    CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less

injury completeness of cord injury and postinjury durations of years or more [] Moderate or severe grade depressivestatus is also associated with neurologic bowel dysfunction in SCI patients Of these risk factors our patienthad complete cord injury that had occurred more than years ago Also many bowel symptoms appear in patients with SCI eg constipation distension incontinence abdominal pain bowel accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  ] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [] Our patient

SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that  of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated

ofincreasinghealthcare costs [] In the postoperative period moderate to severe pain are frequently observed during thefirst  to  h after ambulatory surgery []hassurgerysignificantlyPatient recovery after ambulatory surgery has improvedsince the introduction of the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery a multimodal perioperative care pathwaydesigned to achieve early recovery after surgery []Ambulatoryshortenedhospitalization accelerated turnover and reduced hospitalcosts and rates of nosocomial infections [] However theshortened hospitalization and increased mobility of surgical patients have necessitated the need to improve theefficacy of anesthesia and perioperative managementTherefore postoperative pain and the complicationsarising from its treatment are important considerationsfor patients undergoing ambulatory surgeryVarious drugs have been used to prolong postoperativeanalgesia such as tramadol [] ketorolac [] dexmedetomidine [] ketamine [] and nalbuphine [] Nalbuphine a synthetic opioid agonistantagonist analgesic isprimarily a kappa Îº agonist and a partial mu Î¼ antagonist It has a better safety profile with fewer side effectscompared with other opioids because of its agonist andantagonist activities [] Nalbuphine [] exerts its analgesic and hypnotic effects through its Îº opioid receptorwhich may reduce Î¼ opioid receptorrelated

isstatistically significant compared with T0pain which is the main cause of readmission after daysurgery []According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder Î¼ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration ofnalbuphine for pain relief after ambulatory surgery waslonger than that of tramadol There were  cases of adverse reactions in the nalbuphine group which wasnot significantly different from the  cases  in thetramadol groupThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with nalbuphine is relatively low compared with other opioidmedications A metaanalysis of randomized controlledtrials by Zeng  [] showed that nalbuphine hassimilar analgesic effects compared to morphine and abetter drug safety profile with a low incidence of postoperative pruritusrespiratory inhibition nausea andvomiting In addition studies have reported that antagonism of the Î¼ receptor by nalbuphine could reduce theadverse reactions of other opioids as seen in the combination of morphine and nalbuphine in patientcontrolled analgesia or patientcontrolled epidural analgesia [ ] and the rate of adverse effects such asurinary retention related to morphine pruritus and nausea was significantly less Nalbuphine with sufentanilused in patientcontrolled analgesia could reduce the 0cGuan  BMC Anesthesiology            Page  of incidence of opioidrelated nausea and vomiting and improved patients satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory surgeryAcknowledgementsNot applicableAuthors contributionsGYJ This author contributed to the data

peripheral blood would help to predictefficacy of chemotherapyMethods We examined the immunological characteristics of peripheral blood in CRC patients with capecitabinetreatment We analyzed the relationships between the abnormal immune cell population in capecitabineresistancepatients and major clinical features Furthermore RNA sequencing analyses of cell surface marker expression andthe correlations with other major immune cell populations were performed using this population to explore thepossible function of these cellsResults The expression level of CD16 on neutrophils was downregulated in capecitabineresistant CRC patientsPatients with CD16lowneutrophils after capecitabine therapy had adverse clinical features Whats important thechange of CD16 expression level on neutrophils appeared much earlier than CT scan RNA sequencing revealedthat CD16lowneutrophils in capecitabineresistant patients had lower expression level of neutrophilrelated genescompared to

patients are diagnosed with CRC every year [] Whats more this lifethreaten disease kills nearly  million people annually []In north America and Europe the morbidity and mortalityremain at high level [] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhats more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are indispensable for predicting capecitabineresistance in the early stage after capecitabine therapydetection ofaccuracytheforCancer cells and their microenvironment could interactwith each other Immune cells could dynamically reflectcancer status and display multifaceted functions in cancerdevelopment [] Myeloid cells including monocytesmacrophages granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils and mast cells play critical roles in cancer progression [] Myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs aheterogeneous population of myeloid cells remain at different stages of differentiation are immature counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy []Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFNÎ productionby tumorspecific CD8T cells [] Other researchersshowed that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased amount of HSP70 exosomes on MDSC by 5FUlead to MDSC activation [ ] Yuan Y  found thattumorassociated macrophages secret IL6 to induce 5FUchemoresistance []ImportantlyIn this study we discovered that the expression ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells was dramatically decreased in capecitabineresistant CRC patients after capecitabine adjuvanttherapy The expression level ofCD16 was closely related to poor prognosis after capecitabine therapythe downregulation ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells appeared as early as month

promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell infiltration in CRC tumor tissue represented favorable prognosis [] and by using in vitro studies these studiesalso demonstrated that colon cancer infiltrate neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroups data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16lowmyeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity FcÎ receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target forCRC progression surveillance after capecitabine therapyStudies of CD16 expression on neutrophils may light thepath for not only predicting prognosis but also solvingcapecitabine resistance in CRC

NCD around the world about  of the patients who have diabetes sufferfrom Type  DM T2DM [] The risk of developing T2DM is strongly associated withmany predispositions behavioral and environmental risk factors and also genetic factors [] Besides the genetic factors strong evidence indicates that factors such asobesity and physical inactivity are the main nongenetic determinants of the disease [] T2DM can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to dominant defective secretion with insulin resistance [] It is often related tometabolic syndrome problems Individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance arehighrisk subjects of type  diabetes []Studies demonstrate a drastic increase of the disease in recent decades The trendsestimate that by  more than  million people will be affected by the disease []People who suffer from T2DM are susceptible to many forms of complications leadingto morbidity and mortality in these patients Many studies emphasize the genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM [  ] Long noncoding RNAs long ncRNAslncRNA are subsets of RNA specified as being transcripts with lengths exceeding nucleotides that could not be translated into protein [] Long noncoding RNAslncRNAs belong to a heterogeneous class of regulatory lncRNAs with transcriptlengths   nucleotides which have a positive role in the development and growth ofseveral various diseases including T2DM supporting the hypothesis that abnormal expression of LncRNAs is related to various diseases [] Besides considering the significant role of lncRNAs in disease pathogenesis increasing researches suggest using themto improve diagnosis prognosis and clinical management of T2DM Genomewide association studies GWAS have recently introduced several particular diabetesrelatedloci in the human genome [] Also many studies discovered the relationship betweenmore than  susceptible loci and T2DM at a genomewide significant level [  ]Deregulation of genes located in GWAS defined loci may be risk factors for human diseases concerning which we applied the GWAS catalog to select six lncRNAsLINC00523 LINC00995 CG27_201 TPT1AS1LY86AS1 DKFZP as our gene targets for the present study [] Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD or data miningare techniques for the computational process of discovering patterns in large datasetscontaining various

mining approach for the prediction of T2DM using six lncRNA expressionThe result of this study could improve our knowledge about the early detectionand diagnosis of T2DM using the lncRNAs as biomarkers []MethodsThe primary aim of the present study was to implement four models to predict DT2Mapplying data mining techniques based on the lncRNA variables The research objectives of our study wereImplementing data mining techniques for prediction of the DT2M Comparing the applied methodsselecting the best model for the T2DM prediction 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of We used the variables for predicting T2DM and comparing the performance of thevarious data mining techniques For the implementation of the algorithms we usedANACONDA3  bit a free and  source platform distribution of pythonprogramming language with a vast number of modules packages and rich libraries thatprovide various methods for classification problems For obtaining the best amount ofperformance in the models 10fold crossvalidation performed on the dataset In dealing with the small data sets crossvalidation is a prominent strategy for estimating theperformance CrossValidation is a performance evaluation technique commonly usedin practice Here the data set is repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbors algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem []Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in Fig It maps a set of input data into a set of appropriate output classes It includes threelayers input layer hidden layer  output layer The principal function of neurons of the 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of Fig  Artificial Neural Network structureinput layer is to divide input Xi into neurons in the hidden layer The neuron of thehidden layer adds the appropriate weights of Wij to the input variables The output formula isYj ¼ fWji XiX 10 11Where f is a simple threshold function that we considered sigmoid and hyperbolictangent function []In the present study a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN was performed The structure of MLPNN is as shown in Fig  It makes a map of input dataonto a set of suitable output dataThe RBF networks are another type of neural network In MLP each neuron considers the weighted sum of its input values in which each input value is multiplied by acoefficient and the results are the sum of values RBF is a more intuitive approach toMLP An RBFN classifies the inputs by calculating the inputs similarity to examplesfrom the training set Each RBFN neuron stores one of the examples from the trainingset as a prototype for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability

normalizedthe data inputs for KNN SVM and ANN models We also had low missing variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human Î²cell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility loci have been identified as being associated with T2DM at a genomewidesignificant level [ ] Considering this into account and by querying the GWAS catalog we candidated  lncRNAs LY86AS1 HCG27_201 LINC00523 LINC00994TPT1AS1and DKFZP as target genes for this studyThe large scale GWAS have recognized approximately  SNPs that were susceptibleto T2DM [] From there we used the GWAS catalog access in June  to create alist of SNPs associated with T2DM In the current study we selected six lncRNA forexpression analysis

this research we optimized the parameters of every algorithm and used stratified 10fold crossvalidation togain the best performance To be mentioned in the nearest neighbors algorithm theparameter k was varied between one and nine to find the bestoptimized method andwe selected k   to have the best performance and the lowest standard deviation in theaccuracy of the folds In addition in choosing the parameters of the artificial neuralnetwork the number of hidden layer neurons significantly affects the accuracy of thenetwork so we set the parameters with two hidden layers with five and three

the KNN had the lowest std Moreover the highest accuracy amongthe algorithms was the SVM algorithm and Logistic regression which had the maximum accuracy in folds among others We should mention that the strong points ofour study are using demographic data and six Long noncoding RNAs and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher number of samples wouldlead to higher performance and more reliable resultsConclusionIn this paper the performance of conventional data mining classification techniqueshas been calculated and compared for a dataset of patients referred for the screeningof type  diabetes to the Shohada Hospital Iran The biomarker applied in this studydemonstrated high diagnostic value and the diagnostic process is suitable which couldhelp in the diagnosis of prediabetes and T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and logistic regression In data mining it isnot possible to say one classification technique will always work best and it often depends on the number of samples their distribution and the choosing of the right algorithm In this research work SVM and Logistic Regression had the best Area UnderCurve among methods of classification with the mean AUC of  KNN and ANNalso had the high mean AUC and small

the fact that the previous study included multiple caprine breeds that were represented by small to moderate numbers of individuals Given the low frequencies of CNV in our study the average frequency of CNV is  such a design would probably underestimate the levels of the diversity of CNV at the withinbreed level We also observed that functions related with sensory perception metabolism and embryo development are overrepresented in the set of genes that overlapped with CNV and that these loci often belong to large multigene families with tens hundreds or thousands of paralogous members a

disease  []  is  caused  by  the segregation of CNV Genome scans to detect structural variations  in  cattle  have  revealed  that  CNV  regions CNVR are often enriched in genes that are involved in immunity [] metabolism [ ] embryo development [ ] and sensory perception [ ] There is evidence that the  dNdS ratios of genes that map to taurine CNV are generally higher than those of genes that do not overlap with CNV which indicates that CNV genes probably evolve under reduced selective constraint [] The analysis of gene networks has also shown that genes that  colocalize  with  duplications  tend  to  have  fewer interactions with other genes than loci that do not overlap  with  CNV  reinforcing  the  idea  that  genes  mapping to duplicated regions have fewer essential housekeeping functions  than  nonCNV  genes  and  also  have  reduced pleiotropy []Although structural chromosomal variations can have strong  effects  on  gene  expression  and  phenotypic  variability  technical  limitations  and  the  moderate  quality of genome assemblies have hampered CNV mapping in livestock  []  Until  recently  this  has  been  particularly true for goats In  Fontanesi et a0al [] published the first  caprine  CNV  map  by  identifying  with  the  Bovine a0k aCGH array  CNVR including  and  copy loss and gain variants respectively Later on resequencing  the  genome  of  individuals  from  several  caprine breeds  made  it  possible  to  identify  CNV  that  overlap with  pigmentation genes and to detect an association between increased ASIP copy number and light pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic processes and embryonic development [] Moreover the patterns of the diversity of CNV differed according to geographic origin  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  influenced by population history [] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a single Spanish breed MurcianoGranadina  and  to  investigate  the  functional  roles  of genes that map to CNVR and compare these results with data obtained in

BeadChip analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term sensory perception was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms olfactory transduction  fold  enrichment    and  Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that sensory perception of smell and Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that sensory perceptions of smell and chemical  stimuli  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the sensory perception functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  []  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  []  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

mouse salivary tissues []Cell Detection MethodsThe following methods have been used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [  ] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   ]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take  a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions

Thetreatment rate is much lower in males than in females[] Meanwhile more men than women die every yeardue to hip fractures [] Hence we also included menin the study population to determine the risk factors forosteoporosisSome studies about the influence of sex on osteoporosis remain controversial In our study there was a significant relationship between H pylori and osteoporosisin premenopausal females but not in males The reasonsfor the difference between males and females are asfollows First differences in clinical outcomes of osteoporosis in men and women may be rooted in the biologic properties of bone BarrettConnor E holds theview that there are sexspecific differences in the number of osteoprogenitor cells and in hormone responsesand regulation [ ] Second men have a greater bonesize trabecular BMD and bone area at the radius andtibia than women even after adjusting for weight andheight which may lead to a decrease in osteoporosis andfracture [] Third men undergo a slow decrease inBMD with increasing age while women experience aprofound period of rapid bone resorption especiallyafter entering menopause [] Last but not least somestudies support the idea that men are more likely to suffer from secondary diseasefor example rheumatoidarthritis alcoholism excessive smoking gonadal deficiencies and others [] which may lead to sustainablebone lossUnfortunately the relationship between osteoporosisand H pylori infection is still controversial Some studieshold the view that there is no difference between menand women in the relationship between H pylori andosteoporosis [ ] Some studies hold the view that Hpylori is related to osteoporosis only in women ShihChun Lin conducted a retrospective study including women and showed that H pylori is related to osteoporosis in females [] while others think that there is nocorrelation between them in females Daisuke Chindaconducted a study of  healthy women and found thatH pylori is not a significant risk factor for oste ia[] In our study we analysed the relationship betweenH pylori infection and osteoporosis We found a significant relationship between H pylori infection status andbone density in premenopausal females but not in malesWe suspect this may be due to the difference in the aetiology of osteoporosis between males and females However we did not find any other studies on this and itrequires more systematic research for analysisAfter analysing the differences between males and females we found that there were significant differencesin BMI WHR and TG in the study population Thisstudy provides evidence for followup research on sexdifferences in the relationship between H pylori andosteoporosisMost studies hold the view that obesity is related toosteoporosis [] It is generally believed that obesitymay be a protective factor against bone loss and osteoporosis [] However the effect of obesity remains unclear On the one hand obesity has traditionally beenconsidered positive for bone because of the beneficial effect of mechanicalloading [] On the other handpeople hold the view that BMI may harm BMD Osteoblasts and adipocytes both stem from marrow mesenchymal

pylori infection is associated with a decrease in bone density The possible reasons are as follows First H pylori infection may causesystemic inflammation and increase the production oftumour necrosis factorÎ± interleukin1 and interleukin [] These cytokines are directly involved in the reduction of BMD We found that HCY is related toosteoporosis which supports this hypothesis Secondosteoporosis may be related to a decrease in vitamin B12levels [] Serin et als study examined  patientswithout atrophy erosions or ulcers and they found thatthe histopathological scores for both antral and corpusH pylori density and inflammation were significantly inversely associated with serum vitamin B12 levels [] Inour study although we did not find a significant relationship between B12 and osteoporosis we still supportthe relevant theory The absence of our results may bedue to a lack of sufficient data and the influence of confounding factors Last but notleast most patientschronically infected with H pylori manifest pangastritiswith reduced acid secretion due to bacterial virulencefactors inflammatory cytokines and various degrees ofgastric atrophy [] Calcium is ionized in acidic conditions and absorbed in the small bowel Therefore in either hypochlorhydria or achlorhydric stomachs calciumabsorption is impaired [] Moreover the longtermuse of acid suppressants for example proton pump inhibitors may lead to osteoporosis or a decrease in BMDLimited experimental evidence indicates that PPI mayinfluence calcium absorption leading to compensatoryphysiologic responsesincluding secondary hyperparathyroidism which may cause an increase in the rate ofosteoclastic bone resorption [] The results showedthat calcium had a trend though it was not statisticallysignificant P   with osteoporosis Our results donot support the theory that there is a correlation between Ca and osteoporosis but it may be that Helicobacter pyloriinfection may cause calcium absorptiondamage and affect BMD We did not analyse vitamin Dlevels which could affect both bone homeostasis and theinflammatory state [] Although H pyloriinfectioncausing a decrease in bone density is supported by

targeted by miR2861Finally the mechanisms by which miR2861 functionedto affect the differentiation of hMSCs were exploredOur bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay resultsshowed that AKT2 could bind with miR2861 Fig 6aand b In addition overexpression of miR2861 decreased the expression levels of AKT2 and downregulation of SNHG14 reduced the expression of AKT2Fig 6c and dDiscussionsOsteoblastic differentiation from hMSCs many originates from many cell events that are affected by variousmolecular and cellular procedures during the development of bone and skeleton It is crucial to reveal important factors that mediate this phenomenon and to studythe underlying mechanisms Owing to the successfulfindings from the previous studies different lncRNAshave been shown to participate in the osteoblast differentiation by targeting corresponding cell signaling pathways One study revealed the expression profiling of 0cDu  BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders            Page  of

Expression of osteoblast marker genes of RUNX2 OSX ALP and OC at day N   p  lncRNAs in C3H10T12 mesenchymal stem cells undergoing early osteoblast differentiation [] LncRNA H19promoted osteoblast differentiation via the TGF1Smad3HDAC signaling pathway by deriving miR675[]Various lncRNAs and miRNAs are dysregulated during the hMSCs differentiation of osteoblast [ ] Inour study we found a similar phenomenon We firstlyanalyzed the expression of SNHG14 and miR2861 inserum and hMSCs of osteoporosis patients Comparedto nonosteoporosis participants the expression levels ofSNHG14 in serum and hMSCs of osteoporosis patientswere greatly elevated The expression of miR2861 wasdrastically downregulated in hMSCs of osteoporosisgroup A negative relationship was established betweenthe expression of SNHG14 and miR2861 in serum ofosteoporosis group Similar to previous studies we identified that lncRNA SNHG14 was upregulated but miR was downregulated in serum and hMSCs from patients with osteoporosisFig  AKT2 was targeted by miR2861 a Shared binding sequences between AKT2 and miR2861 b Dualluciferase reporter assay c and dWestern blot assay of AKT2 protein expression levels N   p   0cDu  BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders            Page  of With the common shared binding sequences lncRNAscould target their specific miRNAs and exert the biological roles in the pathogenesis of many cellular procedures [] For examplelncRNA DGCR5 acts as atumor suppressor in papillary thyroid carcinoma via targeting miR2861 [] We first confirmed the commonbinding sequences between SNHG14 and miR2861 Cotransfection of SNHG14 ²UTR with miR2861 led tothe suppression of luciferase activities compared withthat of SNHG14 MUT Moreover shSNHG14 elevatedthe expression levels of miR2861 The relative expression levels of SNHG14 were also lowered in cells transfected with miR2861 As far as we know we are thefirst to reveal that SNHG14 is targeted by miR2861 during the hMSCs differentiation to osteoblastAccording to previous reports ALP is highly expressedin osteoblast which is an important indicator for maturedifferentiation of osteoblast [] Osteoblastspecific genesRUNX2 Osterix ALP and OC are also critical genes to indicate the existing of osteoblast [ ] To investigatethe effects of SNHG14 on hMSC osteoblast differentiation we induced hMSCs differentiation to osteoblastsafter transfection with shSNHG14 or shNC The expression of SNHG14 was suppressed in cells transfected withshSNHG14 Suppression of SNHG14 markedly loweredosteoblastic differentiation which was indicated by lowerexpression levels of the osteoblastspecific genes RUNX2Osterix ALP and OC decreased ALP activity and in vitromatrix mineralization by Alizarin red staining inshSNHG14 transfected hMSCs compared with cells transfected with shNC Similar to previous reports [ ] wealso observed that silencing of SNHG14 could suppresshMSCs differentiation to osteoblastsA novel regulation role of Runx2miR3960miR2861was demonstrated in mouse osteoblast differentiation []MiR2861 was found to promote osteoblast differentiationby increasing the expression of Runx2 [] To investigatethe effects of miR2861 on hMSC osteoblast differentiationwe induced hMSCs to differentiate to osteoblasts aftertransfection with miR2861mimic or miRNC Overexpression of miR2861 greatly suppressed osteoblastic differentiation which was indicated by lower expression levelsof the osteoblastspecific genes RUNX2 OSX ALP andOC and decreased ALP activity and reduced in vitromatrix mineralization in miR2861mimic transfectedhMSCs compared to cells transfected with miRNC Different from the previous study [] we noticed that miR2861suppressed osteoblast differentiation of hMSC Moreoverwe observed that the effects of SNHG14 on osteoblast differentiation of hMSC were attenuated by miR2861ConclusionsIn  our data confirmed that the induction effects of SNHG14 on osteoblast differentiation of hMSCswere attenuated by miR2861 SNHG14 could induceosteogenic differentiation of hMSC in vitro by targetingmiR2861Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at
