The comparison between pre-/post-treatment groups was performed by modified paired T-test using the limma package. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Samples were tested for ALK rearrangements by FISH (Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit) as previously described30. Gene expression analysis RNA from cell lines and controls was prepared labeled and hybridized to Illumina HT-12 array. For analysis the sample probe profile data in the GeneSpring export format was transformed to log-2 scale and normalized using quantile method by applying beadarray package31 in BioConductor 2.11. Four duplicated samples were averaged to reduce the total sample size to 9 across three groups. The comparison between drug sensitive and drug resistant groups was performed using limma package. The significantly changed probes were identified by moderated t statistics. The p-values from moderated t-tests were adjusted by Benjamini and Hochberg's method to control false discovery rate.

Xenograft studies Nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan Laboratories) were used for in vivo studies and were cared for in accordance with guidelines approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research Animal Resource Center. 8 week old female mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 million H3122 cells together with matrigel. Once tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm3 mice were randomized to the different treatment cohorts. For the experiment in Supplementary Fig. 1f mice were randomized to receive either crizotinib alone MAb391 alone crizotinib + MAb391 or vehicle control (n = 6 for vehicle alone crizotinib and crizotinib + MAb391. n = 5 for MAb391 only). Crizotinib was administered at 50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days. MAb391 was administered at 1 mg i.p. every 3 days. For the experiment in Fig. 6b mice were randomized to receive crizotinib alone (50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days) LDK-378 alone (50 mg kg?1 p.o. daily \\u0097 5 days) or vehicle control (n = 5 for Crizotinib and LDK-378 n = 4 for vehicle control). Mice were observed daily throughout the treatment period for signs of morbidity/mortality. Tumors were measured twice weekly using calipers and volume was calculated using the formula: length \\u0097 width2 \\u0097 0.52. Body weight was also assessed twice weekly. P values were determined with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. EML4-ALK (E13;A20) transgenic mice Genetically engineered mice harboring the EML4-ALK E13;A20 fusion variant has been previously reported13. Three month old mice from both genders were used in the described studies. All animal treatment studies were reviewed and approved by the IACUC at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Tumor Biopsy Samples All patient tumor biopsy samples were obtained under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols (Vanderbilt University IRB# 050644 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center IRB #10-136 University Hospital of Cologne IRB #06037 Peter MacCallum Cancer Center IRB#08/71). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All samples were deidentified and protected health information was reviewed according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. For the index patient's tumor clinical genotyping was performed using the SNaPshot platform as previously described32. Immunohistochemistry Tumors were pathologically identified and classified according to WHO guidelines. Briefly 3 ?m thick sections of FFPE tumors were deparaffinized. For pIGF-1R staining antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the section in citrate buffer at pH 6 for 25 minutes. For IRS-1 staining no pretreatment was necessary. Primary antibodies were used as follows: pIGF-1R (pY1161) (Ab39398 1:100 pH 6 Abcam Inc.) IRS-1 (Ab40777 1:100 Abcam Inc.). Corresponding secondary antibodies and detection kits were used (Enhancer: post antibody blocking for Bright Vision plus; Immuno Logic c-DPVB blocking and Polymer: Poly-HRP-GAM/R/R IgG; Immuno Logic c-DPVB999HRP BrightVision+ cat #DPVB999HRP ImmunoLogic Duiven The Netherlands www.immunologic.nl) and stained on an automated stainer (LabVision Autostainer 480S Thermo Scientific). Staining intensities were individually evaluated by 3 independent observers.

Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and characterized by a poor prognosis. It has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their partners. Recently it has been shown that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients. The generalization of these results is limited since most participants were female patients with breast cancer. Moreover only one study examined the effectiveness of MBSR in partners of cancer patients. Therefore in the present trial we study the effectiveness of MBSR versus treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Methods/Design A parallel group randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare MBSR with TAU. Lung cancer patients who have received or are still under treatment and their partners are recruited. Assessments will take place at baseline post intervention and at three-month follow-up. The primary outcome is psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes are quality of life (only for patients) caregiver appraisal (only for partners) relationship quality and spirituality. In addition cost-effectiveness ratio (only in patients) and several process variables are assessed. Discussion This trial will provide information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in patients with lung cancer and their partners. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01494883. Mindfulness-based stress reduction Lung cancer patients Partners Psychological distress Randomized controlled trial Background With an estimated 1.4 million deaths per year lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. Even with the best available treatment five-year survival is merely 16% and about 60 to 70% of patients die within the first year after diagnosis [1]. This poor prognosis is often caused by a late diagnosis as the presentation usually occurs when the lung cancer is advanced. Patients may develop burdensome symptoms like pain dyspnoea fatigue and cough and they may undergo radical treatment including surgery chemo- and radiotherapy. Not surprisingly lung cancer has a major impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and their family. Akechi and colleagues [2] showed that 19% of patients with advanced lung cancer meets the criteria of psychiatric disorders especially depressive and adjustment disorders. Of patients who had been successfully treated for lung cancer 15% met the criteria for a minor or major depressive disorder [3]. The prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among lung cancer patients ranges from 20 to 47% [4-7]. Compared to patients with other cancer diagnoses lung cancer patients report the highest rates of distress (43 to 58%) [89] resulting in a lower quality of life [10]. Family friends and especially partners of patients with lung cancer also have to deal with its psychological impact [11-14]. Partners not only provide emotional and practical support they also have to cope with their own concerns including the uncertainty regarding the course of the illness and the fear of losing their partner [15]. More than 50% of partners of lung cancer patients report negative emotional effects of caregiving [16]. Around 40% of partners of patients with advanced lung cancer report high levels of distress [17]. The relationship between patient and partner can also be affected by the cancer. It has been shown that some partners report a lower quality of their relationship after the diagnosis of lung cancer [18]. Though numerous studies examined the psychological distress of lung cancer patients and their partners [2-22] not much research is done on how to alleviate distress in these groups [23]. In addition the available studies on managing the psychosocial care needs of cancer patients and their families have focused on care at the very end of life (e.g. [24-26]). Recently studies have demonstrated that palliative care initiated early in treatment improves the quality of life and depressive symptoms of lung cancer patients [1027]. This stresses the importance of integrating psychosocial care for lung cancer patients and their partners early in the treatment rather than instigating it once life-prolonging therapies fail. In the past ten years MBSR has become a promising psychosocial intervention for cancer patients. Mindfulness is defined as intentionally paying attention to moment-by-moment experiences in a non-judgmental way [28]. MBSR is an 8-week group-based training consisting of meditation practices such as the bodyscan gentle yoga sitting and walking meditation. By repeatedly bringing attention back to the current experience participants gradually learn to disengage from dysfunctional thoughts and directly experience the emotions and bodily sensations of the present moment. MBSR aims to provide participants with the ability to step back from ruminating about the past or worrying about the future and simply allow experiences to unfold [2829]. A recent meta-analysis [30] of 13 nonrandomized studies and 9 randomized controlled trials (RCT) concluded there is positive evidence for the use of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. Among the RCT\\u0099s a reduction in symptom severity was found for both anxiety and depression corresponding to moderate pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges\\u0099s g = 0.37 and Hedges\\u0099s g = 0.44 respectively) [30]. Though mindfulness-based interventions seem to be effective the authors note that across studies the majority of participants were women (85%) and diagnosed with breast cancer (77%). Compared to breast cancer patients patients with lung cancer are more often male older and have a poorer prognosis. Furthermore of these 22 studies only one study included the partners of the patients showing that partners also benefit from the MBSR training [31]. This is quite surprising since partners of cancer patients also report high levels of distress [32]. Aims The aim of the Mindfulness for Lung Oncology Nijmegen (MILON) study is to examine the effectiveness of MBSR compared to TAU in reducing psychological distress in patients with lung cancer and their partners. We hypothesize that patients in the MBSR group will report a lower level of psychological distress (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms) higher levels of quality of life quality of relationship and spirituality than those in the TAU group. Medical and societal costs will be lower in the MBSR versus TAU group. We expect partners in the MBSR group to report a lower level of psychological distress and higher levels of caregiver appraisal relationship quality and spirituality than their counterparts in the TAU group. With regard to the working mechanisms of the MBSR programme we will examine changes in mindfulness skills self-compassion rumination intrusion avoidance and adherence to MBSR. Methods/Design Study design The design of the \\u0098MILON\\u0099 study is a parallel group randomized controlled trial with an embedded process study. Participants are randomized between MBSR and TAU. The study protocol has been approved by our ethical review board (CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen) and registered under number 2011\\u0093519.

the infection had spread worldwiderapidly and COVID19 has reached pandemic levels InSouth Korea since its outbreak in February  COVID has affected profoundly every aspect of communities Thehumantohuman transmission of COVID19 provides challenges for all healthcare facilities and healthcare providersIn the face of the COVID19 pandemic the Korean Societyof Nuclear Medicine KSNM Korean Society of InfectiousDisease KSID and Korean Society for HealthcareAssociated Infection Control and Prevention KOSHIC haveprepared the guidance for the nuclear medicine department tominimize confusion and ensure that nuclear medicine physicians and technicians continue to provide their services whileprotecting the patients and workers and preventing the transmission of the virus The Quality Control Committee ofKSNM reviewed several reports and recommendations previously published by the European Association of NuclearMedicine EANM [] Society of Nuclear Medicine andMolecular Imaging SNMMI American Society of NuclearCardiology ASNC [] International Atomic Energy AgencyIAEA and others [\\u0093] This guidance is basically in compliance with the COVID19 guidelines of the Korea Centersfor

              "the periparturient period is one of the most challenging periods in dairy cows and encompasses the  a0wk prior to and  a0wk after parturition  the  nutrient  requirements  of  dairy  cows  change greatly during this time largely due to the exponential growth of the gravid uterus and fetus followed by the demands of lactation nrc  inflammation oxidative stress and adipose tissue mobilization  lead  to  a  reduction  in  dry  matter  intake  dmi during the periparturient period this reduction in dmi leads to a negative nutrient balance nnb with a shortfall in the nutrient availability  for  the  cow  and  fetus  ingvartsen  and  andersen   additionally  this  reduction  in  dmi  also  increases  the risk of metabolic ketosis fatty liver milk fever and immunerelated disorders the risk of these diseases poor reproduction and low efficiency is greatly impacted by the degree and length of time during which these systems metabolism and immune response remain out of balance loor et a0al 2013a much of the research  over  the  last  decade  have  examined  these  biological interactions to identify the mechanisms behind the metabolic physiologic  and  immune  adaptations  that  occur  during  the periparturient period loor et a0al 2013a 2013b roche et a0al  bradford et a0al it  is  now  known  that  nutrients  such  as  amino  acids  aa serve  functional  roles  outside  of  their  use  as  building  blocks for  proteins  and  have  immunomodulatory  properties  and interact through common biochemical pathways eg 1carbon metabolism  figure a0   this  concept  has  been  well  explored in  nonruminant  species  li  et a0 al    sikalidis    with nutritional  management  during  the  periparturient  period continuing  to  be  an  active  area  of  research  it  is  important  to develop a system understanding the potential immunometabolic role  that  dietary  aa  may  play  during  this  period  thus  the objective of this review is to provide an overview of physiological adaptations  during  the  periparturient  period  the  immune system and methods to assess immune function and oxidative stress this will be followed by a more specific discussion of the immunometabolic roles of specific aa and their potential effects in  dairy  cow  during  the  periparturient  period  the  potential effects  of  enhanced  aa  supply  during  the  preweaning  period will also be discussed brieflybiological adaptations in the transition cowa brief overviewduring  the  nnb  associated  with  the  periparturient  period biological  mechanisms

proinflammatory  cytokines  interleukin  il6  il1  and tumor necrosis factorÎ± tnfÎ± kindt et a0al  additionally oxidative  stress  also  occurs  during  this  period  and  is  driven by  the  imbalance  between  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen metabolites  rom  reactive  nitrogen  species  rns  and  the neutralizing  capacity  of  antioxidant  mechanisms  in  tissues and  blood  some

[stat3]  nuclear  factorkappa b  [nfÎºb] the  increase  in  oxidative  stress  and  inflammation during this period is also negatively associated with a reduction in  liver  functionality  and  measurement  of  app  can  provide a  useful  tool  to  assess  liver  function  as  well  as  inflammation bertoni and trevisi during  the  periparturient  period  aa  metabolism  is  also altered  with  moderate  carcass  protein  losses  reported  even when animals are fed to their predicted metabolizable protein requirements  bell  et a0 al    additionally  circulating  aa concentrations  change  dramatically  with  favorable  circulating profiles  of  many aa  not  being  restored  until    d  postpartum zhou et a0al 2016b furthermore the total concentration of aa in plasma reaches a nadir around day  postpartum zhou et a0al 2016b which corresponds to a peak in total disease incidence during  early  lactation  ingvartsen    this  decrease  in circulating  aa  is  likely  associated  with  the  increased  use  of aa  for  gluconeogenesis  as  well  as  for  hepatic  production  of app thus it is important to investigate how supplemental aa during  the  periparturient  period  may  modulate  metabolism and  immune  responses  to  promote  production  and  reduce susceptibility to diseasegeneral overview of the immune a0systemthe immune system consists of both the adaptive and innate immune responses which are linked together through signaling molecules  such  as  cytokines  the  innate  immune  system  is the  first  line  of  defense  and  includes  physical  barriers  such as  epithelial  cell  layers  that  express  tight  cell  junctions  and the  mucus  layer  of  the  respiratory  gastrointestinal  and genitourinary tracts chaplin  cells involved in the innate immune  response  include  macrophages  polymorphonuclear neutrophils  pmn  dendritic  cells  mast  cells  eosinophils natural killer cells and natural killer t cells turvey and broide  the  focus  of  the  present  review  is  on  the  effects  of aa on  phagocytic  cells  that  is  cells  that  engulf  and  kill  such  as macrophages  and  pmn  macrophages  not  only  phagocytose invading pathogens but also produce cytokines such as ils and tnfÎ±  which  initiate  innate  and  adaptive  immune  responses and recruit pmn to the site of infection chaplin the  adaptive  immune  response  consists  of t  lymphocytes b  lymphocytes  and  humoral  factors  marshall  et a0 al   there  are  two  types  of t  lymphocytes  cytotoxic t  cells  cd8 cells and thelper th cells cd4 cells marshall et a0al  cytotoxic t  cells  detect  and  eliminate  infected  cells  while th cells produce ils and interferonÎ³ ingvartsen and moyes  the b lymphocytes are cells that produce antibodies that bind to  antigens  on  the  surface  of  pathogens  to  mark  them  for destruction marshall et a0al  0ccoleman et a0al   s177aa immune function and oxidative a0stressduring  the  periparturient  period  the  metabolic  status  is associated with the inflammatory regulation of peripheral blood mononuclear  cells  with  a  more  pronounced  inflammatory response in those cells during the nnb immediately postpartum agrawal  et a0 al    mann  et a0 al    this  period  is  also associated  with  altered  signaling  of  nutrientsensing  kinases in  immune  cells  such  as  the  protein  kinase  b  akt  and mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  mtor  pathway  which  may modulate cytokine production mann et a0al  aa can directly and indirectly alter the immune system besides being used in energy metabolism reactions and the synthesis of proteins aa are critical for the synthesis of other functional molecules such as the antioxidants gsh and taurine no histamine and hydrogen peroxide  li  et a0 al   thus  this  section  of  the  review  will focus on the role that aa play in modulating immune function and  oxidative  stress  in  dairy  cows  during  the  periparturient period a a0special focus will be placed on aa involved in 1carbon metabolism as this represents an interconnected route through which  aa  could  impact  molecular  events  such  as  epigenetic regulation  protein  synthesis  via  mtor  energy  metabolism and antioxidant synthesis a a0summary of studies investigating the  effects  of aa  on  immune  function  and  oxidative

growth factors nutrients particularly aa and energy powell et a0al  in dairy cattle mtor has traditionally been studied in the context of its role in regulating protein synthesis however work from humans and nonruminant species has indicated that mtor is an important regulator  of  immune  responses  powell  et a0 al    jones  and pearce  when activated by aa mtor directs an activation of anabolic metabolism which allows growth proliferation and development this  makes  the  activation  of  mtor  in  immune cells  particularly  important  for  maintaining  proliferation  and without

indicated  that  insulin  sensitivity  of  the  mammary gland was enhanced with supplemental met ma et a0al  in subcutaneous adipose tissue the mrna and protein abundance of  some  aa  transporters  and  pmtor  were  upregulated  with enhanced  met  supply  while  changes  in  insulin  signaling  and plasma glucose also indicated that met helped improve insulin sensitivity  liang  et a0 al  2019b  thus  enhancing  met  supply during  the  periparturient  period  may  lead  to  mtor  activation in  immune  cells  as  well  as  improved  nutrient  uptake  which could help to support

complex mechanisms are also likelyinvolved in the dxr resistance in cd44cd133 cells discussionby using the wellrecognized cell surface markers of cd44and cd133 for csc identiï¬cation we tried to separate thehct8 human colon cancer cells into cd44 cd44 cd44cd133 and cd44cd133 subpopulations and then investigated how the expressions of cd44 and cd133 associatedwith drug resistance actually we checked several cancer celllines on the expression of cd44 and cd133 including helacells and a549 cells however both hela cells and a549 cellsshowed almost  expression of cd44 only the hct8cells showed a partial expression of cd44 about  anda rare expression of cd133 therefore we only isolateddiï¬erent subpopulations from hct8 cells for this studyfirst we found that the expression level of cd44 keptvery stable in the cd44cd133 cells but gradually declinedin cd44cd133 cells during a cell passaging process on theother hand some of cd44 cells shifted to express cd44 during a cell passaging process figure 1c these ï¬ndings suggested the plasticity of cd44 expression in hct8 cellsactually ohata et al reported that cd44 highexpressedcells from human intractable colon cancer patients can diï¬erentiate into cd44 lowexpressed cells and a fraction of cd44lowexpressed cells can also generate cd44 highexpressedcells in a xenograft mouse model   however it is unclearwhy the cd44cd133 cells but not cd44cd133 cellsstably maintain the expression level of cd44 unlike theextensive expression of cd44 with high plasticity the expression of cd133 was only observed in very few of the hct8cells with poor plasticitya number of previous studies have demonstrated thatcscs are likely resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thecd44cd133 cells but not the cd44 and cd44cd133cells showed dxr resistance figure 2a according to thisdata the expression of cd133 but not cd44 seems to beclosely associated with drug resistance actuallythesecd44cd133 cells showed the enhanced expression ofabcb1 and the decreased intracellular accumulation ofdxr figures 2b and 2c liu et al reported that nonsmallcell lung cancer cells treated with lowdose cddp aresuï¬cient to enrich cd133 cells and upregulate abcb1expression through notch signaling which thereforeincreases the crossresistance to dxr   however theinhibition of abcb1 by verapamil only partially improvedthe dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells in this studyto ï¬nd other potential mechanisms involving in thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells we investigatedseveral interesting aspects including the stress protectionand redox regulation we found that p38mapk one of themost popular protein kinases known to be activated byinï¬ammatory cytokines lipopolysaccharide osmotic shockultraviolet light and other stresses was more obviouslyinduced by dxr in cd44cd133 cells than cd44cd133cells figure  moreover the activation of p38 mapk wasnot dependent on the intracellular accumulation of dxrfigure dxr is known to insert between the base pairs of dna oftumor cells and exhibits antitumor eï¬ects by suppressing thebiosynthesis of both dna and rna through the inhibitionof dna polymerase rna polymerase and topoisomeraseii reactions furthermore it is believed that dxr has theability to generate suï¬cient ros to raise oxidative stressindeed we observed dxrinduced ros generation in bothcd44cd133 and cd44cd133 cells butthe dxrinduced ros generation was detected even higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells independent on the intracellular accumulation of dxr figures 5a 2b and 3bsuggesting the enhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsthe keap1nrf2 control system plays a central role in theantioxidant defense mechanisms nrf2 is known as a transcription factor to activate various genes involving in biological defense mechanisms it has been reported that nrf2 isconstantly expressed in many cancer cells [] moreover the enhanced expression of nrf2 has been conï¬rmedto associate with poor prognosis of cancer patients []in our

accumulationfigure 5b these ï¬ndings also clearly indicate theenhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsalthough the absence of direct evidence by interferenceexperiment pathways involving in the stress protection andredox regulation might at least partially contributed to thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsvery strangely our data showed that the silencing ofcd133 expression in cd44cd133 cells by sirna couldonly partially increase the cytotoxicity of dxr figure 6bbut did not change the expression of abcb1 and the intracellular accumulation of dxr figure 6c other unknownmechanisms

conservativesurgical approach   it is thought that the removal of the entirecolon will prevent the development of metachronous tumorsand a previous study indicated that subtotal colectomy mayincrease

diverse important signal moleculesinvolved in tumor angiogenesis and progression and cancercell metabolism have been identiï¬ed as direct ppar betadelta target genes angiogenesisangiogenesis is the physiological process through which anew capillary network forms from the preexisting vasculature[ ] whereas vasculogenesis denotes de novo bloodvessel formation mostly during embryogenesis in whichendothelial progenitor cells epc migrate to sites of vascularization then diï¬erentiate into endothelial cells ec andcoalesce into the initial vascular plexus [ ] besides theinteraction between proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors angiogenesis is also a multiple step biologicalprocess during which a variety of molecules cooperateincluding cell adhesion molecules matrix metalloproteinases 0cppar researchmmps extracellular matrix ecm and basement membrane componentsangiogenesis is a physiological and vital process in development and growth an imbalance of proangiogenic andantiangiogenic factors causes angiogenesis in pathologicalconditions such as diabetic retinopathy and tumor growththus when the imbalance comes to a point at which angiogenesis is triggered by tumor cells then an angiogenicswitch of tumor cells is turned on during tumor progression the angiogenic switch is often activated and remainson [] inducing angiogenesis is known as a hallmarkof cancer   and angiogenesis is also a fundamental stepby which most benign tumors transition into malignant ones tumor angiogenesis tumor needs to sprout new vesselsand further develop a vascular network in order to supplynutrients and oxygen remove waste products support a continually high proliferative rate and ultimately expand neoplastic growth [ ] hence angiogenesis is essential forhelping sustain tumor growth and facilitate tumor progression besides being a requirement for angiogenesis an abnormal vasculature also helps to promote tumor progression andmetastasis the tumor vascular wall is imperfect and prone toleakage so it is much easier for tumor cells to directly penetrate into the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and then proliferate at another distant site to form metastasis  due to intensive abnormal neovascularization in tumortissues most malignant tumors grow rapidly and acquirethe ability to spread to adjacent and distant ans whichmakes them more malignant and even life threateningtherefore angiogenesis indeed plays an important role intumor progression and metastasis and to intervene with thisprocess would obviously prevent tumor development andspread thus this has been regarded as a critical target forantitumor therapy ppar alpha and angiogenesisit was reported ï¬rstly that a selective ppar alpha agonistwy14643 did not show any eï¬ect

recentlyppar alpha activation is further shown to have antineovascularization eï¬ects with downregulation of vegf and angiopoietin expression in a rat alkali burn model  in summary the role of ppar

as tsp1 and endostatin or downregulation of proangiogenic factors including vegf fgf2 akt and angiopoietins others also reported opposite results showing aproangiogenic role upon ppar alpha activation

  overall the remodeling in skeletalmuscle and heart is perfectly the same as the phenotypeobserved with exercise and both of them are mediatedthrough activation of calcineurinppar betadelta may act as a key regulator in mediatingpathological angiogenesis for instance ppar betadelta wasshown to regulate retinal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivoand its inhibition reduced preretinal

angiogenesislinked to tumor microenvironmentppar betadelta expression is often upregulated and promotes cancer progression in many major human cancerslung breast and gastric cancers []such as colonwhich suggests a crucial role of ppar betadelta in cancercells even though there exist some conï¬icting studies indicating that the functional role of ppar betadelta in tumorigenesis or carcinogenesis still remains highly controversial [] and dependent on speciï¬c tumor or cancer cell typesthus here we discuss the promotion of ppar betadelta intumor progression through facilitating tumor angiogenesisppar betadelta has been suggested as a critical hubnode transcriptional factor which governs a tumor angiogenic switch [ ] in the transcriptional networkanalysis it was reported that tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis were markedly inhibited in ppar betadeltanullmice in comparison with wildtype mice   moreoverthe elevated ppar betadelta expression level was also considered to be highly correlated to pathologically advancedtumor stage and increased cancer risk for recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer   indicating the crucial association of ppar betadelta withtumor angiogenesis progression and cancer invasivenessppar betadelta may indirectly facilitate tumor angiogenesis and progression through its function on the tumormicroenvironment tme where tumor angiogenesis is fostered moreover a tumor also releases some extracellular signals to closely communicate and constantly collaborate withtme to facilitate tumor angiogenesis in order to furtherenable tumor growth and progression for instance it wasshown that colon cancer cells with ppar betadelta knockoutfailed to stimulate ec vascularization in response to hypoxicstress whereas wildtype cells exposed to hypoxia were ableto induce angiogenesis [ ] suggesting that ppar betadelta is required for the promotion of angiogenesis in hypoxic stressmediated tme moreover in the tme tumorltrating myeloid cells are considered as the most important cells for fostering tumor angiogenesis among the multiple diï¬erent kinds of stromal cells   besides stimulatingtumor angiogenesis tumor myeloid cells also support tumrowth by suppressing tumor immunity and promotingtumor metastasis to distinct sites   interestingly it hasbeen demonstrated that ppar betadelta activation intumorltrating myeloid cells stimulates cancer cell invasion and facilitates tumor angiogenesis via an interleukin il10 dependent manner   moreover impairedtumor growth and angiogenesis were observed in pparbetadelta ko bmt mice due to ppar betadelta deï¬ciencyin tumor myeloid cells   suggesting that ppar betadeltaplays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and progression intumor myeloid

unfolded protein response upr upr represents a survival response bythe cells to restore er homeostasis and has both survivaland cell death eï¬ects the mechanisms that determine cellfate during er stress are not well understood for instanceshort exposure to er stress initially increases akt signalingbut longterm er stress suppresses akt signaling  ppar betadelta activation has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum er stressassociated ammation inskeletal muscle through an ampkdependent mechanism  and to reduce ammation in response to chronic erstress in cardiac cells   furthermore it has been nicelyshown that ppar betadelta can repress rasoncogeneinduced er stress to promote senescence in tumors   thisis mediated through the decrease of pakt activity promoting cellular senescence through upregulation of p53 and p27expression   it would be interesting to investigate thedirect eï¬ects of ppar betadelta on senescence of tumorendothelial cells in an in vivo setting we recently showedthat senescent endothelial cells are indispensable for ahealthy lifespan and that removal of senescent endotheliumdisrupts vascular function leading to diminished vessel densities and ï¬brotic lesions   if ppar betadelta mediatessenescence of tumor endothelium thereby protecting vesselintegrity this might explain the enhanced tumor growthand vascularization upon ppar betadelta

function in tmelinked to diverse kinds of cells through direct or indirectmodulation of its downstream molecules interplay between ppar betadelta and ammatoryangiogenesis ammatory angiogenesis is a crucial processin tumor progression for instance the proammatorymediator cyclooxygenase2 cox2 is considered as a keyregulator of angiogenesis and tumor growth through multiple downstream proangiogenic mechanisms such as production of vegf and induction of mmps moreover selectiveinhibition of cox2 has also been shown to suppress angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro   it is well known that vegfaplays a critical role in both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis  and it leads the directional migration of tip cells andstalk cell proliferation in microtubule branches [ ] ithas also been demonstrated that mmp9 triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis and enhances the availability of vegf to its receptors   furthermore it hasbeen reported that ammatory cell mmp9 initiates theonset of tumor neovascularization during which there existsfunctionalincludingmmp9   leptin is shown to mediate angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro through induction of ec proliferationand expression of mmp2 and mmp9   and to furtherpromote ec diï¬erentiation and directional migrationthrough enhancement of cox2 activity   leptin couldalso induce angiogenesis via transactivation of vegfr inecs   additionally besides inducing angiogenesisppar betadelta also functions in chronic ammationfacilitating tumorigenesis through induction of cox2 andits product prostaglandin e2 pge2 in vivo [ ]interestingly cox2 vegf mmp9 and leptin have beenidentiï¬ed as ppar betadelta target genes via a direct transcriptional activation mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells   colorectal cancer

eitherdirectly by attracting ecs towards tumor cells to form newvessels or indirectly by mediating immune ammatorycells to ltrate eventually promoting tumor angiogenesis  chemotaxis of tumor cells and stromal cells in tmeis also required for tumor dissemination during tumor progression and metastasis [ ]cxc chemokines such as cxcl8 encoding il8 andcxcl5 are also involved in cox2associated

cancer stemlike cells   in addition ckitnot only functions on ecs [ ] but also belongs to thetumor angiogenesispromoting molecule [] studiesalso suggested that activation of ckit enhances the expression of vegf that can be suppressed by imatinib an inhibitor of ckit in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells whichthereby has an impact on tumor angiogenesis [ ] ckit is also involved in pathological ocular neovascularization   and is regulated transcriptionally by wt1  and ppar betadelta  pdgfb and its receptor pdgfr beta also known asangiogenic factors are suggested to enhance angiogenesisand vasculogenesis via their function in ecs [] andepcs   and to regulate vascular permeability and vesselmaturation through recruitment of pericytes pcs   and smooth muscle cells smcs   in newly formingvessels moreover pdgfb and pdgfr beta also interactwith other proangiogenic factors such as fgf2 [ ]vegfa and its receptor vegfr2   furthermorepdgfb and pdgfr beta may also aï¬ect cancer growthand progression by directly acting on tme besides thecrosstalk with cafs [] pdgfr beta in stromalï¬broblasts may mediate pdgfbinduced tam recruitment  thus implicating a role of pdgfr beta in tumorstroma to facilitate tumor progression most recently it wasfurther shown that speciï¬c targeting of pdgfr beta kinaseactivity in tme inhibited cancer growth and vascularizationin cancers with high pdgfb expression such as llc  therefore this indicates the diverse role of pdgfb andpdgfr beta in facilitating tumor angiogenesis and progression at diï¬erent cellular levels in tme pdgfr beta is demonstrated as a target of telomeric repeat binding factor trf2 that is further activated transcriptionally by wt1  pdgfb and pdgfr beta have further been identiï¬edas critical targets of ppar betadelta via a direct transactivation mechanism in vivo  in conclusion a variety of key signal molecules involvedin tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression and metastasishave either been identiï¬ed as ppar betadelta direct targetsor largely upregulated in the vascular ppar betadelta overexpression model in vivo reported recently   thus pparbetadelta activation seems to give rise to a highly angiogenicphenotype and even plays a hallmark role in promotingtumor angiogenesis and progression interestingly it appearsthat there could also exist a widely interactive networkbetween the downstream protumorangiogenic moleculesas described above therefore the crosstalk network is established between ppar betadelta and the various signal molecules and also between those molecules figure

mutations in ossn including invasive sccs have not been examined in asianpatients since  approximately  egfr mutations in lung cancer had been registeredin the cosmic the catalog of somatic mutations

in lung cancer [ ]egfr mutations were examined to verify the effect of gefitinib on positive nonsmall celllung carcinoma in two phase iii clinical trials from japan in the nej002 trial and

ossn for pre and postsurgical treatmentthe association of scc with hpv was not confirmed because the number of cases wassmall in addition our results may not be accurate because we did not use multiplex pcrwhich is currently the most suitable genotyping method  ours is the first report to show that differences in the expression form and mutations inegfr in ossn are associated with prognosis and treatmentin an animal model egfr inhibition affected epithelial cell proliferation and stratificationduring corneal epithelial wound healing and may play a role in maintaining normal cornealepithelial thickness  gefitinib is an egfr inhibitor and is the first approved molecular targeted therapy for cancer treatment in japan   thus understanding the pathological role of egfr in ossn andapplying it to treatment are of great significance for seeking new treatment indications inossn including conjunctival sccs in this study egfr may translocate from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm tumor cells may transfer egfr into the cytoplasm by endocytosisto avoid excessive signaling by the feedback system fig    furthermore in this study theegfr mutation was present in many patients with ossn this finding may suggest a courseof treatment in the future in addition the method we used for identification of egfr mutations was not general genotyping but was a judgment of immunohistochemically stained sections although the sensitivity and specificity were high in a previous report this is still alimitation   one  101371 pone0238120 august     one 0cegfr in conjunctival squamous cell carcinomathis study has important limitations first regarding egfr expression on the ocular surface changes in benign diseases and agerelated changes in normal tissues may not have beensufficiently investigated our study found that egfr mutations were also present in conjunctival scc in east asians however we did not obtain results that correlated with the final prognosis further studies including further multiinstitutional studies and an increase in thenumber of cases will be needed in the future another limitation is that double testing of formalinfixed paraffinembedded specimens and plasma with realtime pcr for detection ofegfr mutations is more common than ihc in actual clinical practice according to the literature both the sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for these two types of mutations  in addition the size of our study cohort was small n   and the length of followup lessthan  year in some patients may not have been sufficient for longterm outcome analysestherefore additional studies will be needed to corroborate our findingsin  the results of this study indicate that egfr is an active molecular target inthe pathology of ossn including scc and is a prognostic factor the finding also suggests thatdiscovery of mutations may have important implications for future treatment optionssupporting informations1

              "environmental exposure to arsenite as3 has a strong association with the development ofhuman urothelial cancer uc and is the 5th most common cancer in men and the 12th mostcommon cancer in women muscle invasive urothelial cancer miuc are grouped into basalor luminal molecular subtypes based on their gene expression profile the basal subtype ismore aggressive and can be associated with squamous differentiation characterized byhigh expression of keratins krt1    and  and epidermal growth factor receptoregfr within the tumors the luminal subtype is less aggressive and is predominatelycharacterized by elevated gene expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptamma pparÎ and forkhead box protein a1 foxa1 we have previously shown thatas3transformed urothelial cells ast exhibit a basal subtype of uc expressing genesassociated with squamous differentiation we hypothesized that the molecular subtype ofthe ast cells could be altered by inducing the expression of pparÎ andor inhibiting theproliferation of the cells nontransformed and ast cells were treated with troglitazonetg pparg agonist  Î¼m pd153035 pd an egfr inhibitor  Î¼m or a combination oftg and pd for  days the results obtained demonstrate that treatment of the ast cellswith tg upregulated the expression of pparÎ and foxa1 whereas treatment with pddecreased the expression of some of the basal keratins however a combined treatment oftg and pd resulted in a consistent decrease of several proteins associated with the basalsubtype of bladder cancers krt1 krt14 krt16 p63 and tfap2a our data suggeststhat activation of pparÎ while inhibiting cell proliferation facilitates the regulation of genesinvolved in maintaining the luminal subtype of uc in vivo animal studies are needed toaddress

about  new cases of bc would be identified inthe us and about  deaths would occur from bladder cancer   among bcs urothelialcell carcinomas uc are the most common being the second most diagnosed cancer of thegenitourinary tract behind prostate cancer [ ] it is the 5th most common cancer in menand the 12th most common cancer in women  urothelial cancers are classified as muscle invasive miuc or nonmuscleinvasivenmiuc nonmuscleinvasive urothelial cancers have a lower tendency to progress whereasmiucs have a high rate of metastasis and a  year survival rate of approximately    bothmiuc and nmiuc have been subtyped into various groups with the basal and luminal subtype being the most prominent the luminal subtype of human uc includes the majority ofthe early stage noninvasive ucs and a significant number of miucs this subtype isenriched for papillary histology   is less aggressive and has a more favorable patient outcome [ ] basal classified tumors have a poorer overall survival compared to luminal tumors  they often exhibit squamous differentiation are aggressive and found exclusively inmiuc that metastasize and spread to distal ans   about  of miucs arise independent of the papillary pathway have poor outcomes and an overall  year survival rate of  environmental exposure to arsenite as3 has a strong association with the developmentof human uc the increased risk of uc correlates to the same endemic areas of the worldwhere populations have been identified with arsenicinduced skin cancer [] we havedeveloped a cell culture model of arsenicinduced urothelial cancer by exposing the immortalized nontumorigenic urothelial cell line urotsa to arsenite these transformed cell lines produce tumors in athymic mice that express genes for keratin krt     and  asignature pattern highly similar to the basal subtype of human miuc [ ] the tumorshave a histology similar to urothelialtransitional cell carcinomas with focal areas of squamousdifferentiation [ ] which is associated with poor prognosis [ ]the molecular mechanism driving a tumor towards a basalsquamous subtype is currentlyunknown in a recent study yamashita     show that transcription factor activatingprotein  alpha tfap2a is expressed at high levels in basalsquamous bladder cancerenriched in areas of squamous differentiation and is associated with increase lymph nodemetastasis and distant recurrence of the disease the study also shows that increased expression of tfap2a can facilitate the expression of other transcription factors such as tumor protein p63 tp63p63 also known as p63 which is known to be associated with the basalsubtype of uc   palmbos     demonstrated that p63 binds to the transcriptional regulatory regions of the gene ataxiatelangiectasia group d complementing gene atdc alsoknown as trim29 and krt14 thus increasing their expression the study further showedthat both krt14 and trim29 promote the invasion of the basal subtype of uc in vitro and invivo the luminal subtype of uc is associated with the expression of the transcriptional factorsforkhead box protein a1 foxa1 gata binding protein  gata3 and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma pparÎ [ ] the activation of pparÎ with an agonistcan represses the expression of tfap2a   and inhibit squamous differentiation in vitro the exact role of pparÎ signaling in carcinogenesis is somewhat unclear however theexpression of pparÎ in bladder cancers is a favorable prognostic marker   both in vivoand in vitro studies indicate that pparÎ ligands such as troglitizone can promote differentiation inhibit cellular proliferation induce autophagy and enhance apoptosis in bladder cancer one  101371 pone0237976 august     one 0cactivation of luminal pathway in basal bladder

the expression of the transcription factor foxa1   and this is contrary to what is seen in our study these differencescould be due to the cell type since we are using immortalized cells the as3transformedurotsa cells showed an induction in the expression of pparÎ and foxa1 when treated withtg however the expression of gata3 in these transformed lines was not consistent in bccell lines studies by others have shown that have shown that gata3 and foxa1 cooperatewith pparÎ activation to drive the differentiation of a basal bladder cancer subtype to a moredifferentiated luminal subtype   other studies have also linked the expression of foxa1 tothe development of the luminal subtype of urothelial cancer [] in our studies treatmentwith tg did result in the differentiation of the as3transformed cells based upon morphological changes and induced the expression of pparÎ as well as foxa1 both of which are factorsknown to drive luminal differentiation of bladder cancer cell linessignaling via the pparÎ pathway is essential for the growth arrest and terminal differentiation of adipocytes   and other normal epithelial [] and cancer cells [] whereassignaling via the egfr receptor plays a role in cell proliferation the keratins play an essentialrole in the differentiation of epithelial cells and different keratin profiles are expressed at different stages of differentiation the normal bladder has three different stages of differentiationand these stages are marked by the expression of krt14 krt5 and krt20   krt14 isexpressed in a subset of basal cells that are thought to play a role in regeneration as well astumorigenesis   whereas other basal cells and intermediate cells in the normal bladderexpress krt5 the expression of krt20 is restricted to the most differentiated cells theumbrella cells   these differentiation stages of the bladder are shared by bladder cancersand malignant transformation can occur in any of the different cell types of the bladder theexpression of krt14 is seen in the least of the differentiated tumors and its expression correlates to poor prognosis krt14   whereas the expression of krt20 is restricted to differentiated bladder cancers and its expression is associated with good prognosis   a study doneby varley     showed that normal human urothelial cells in culture express krt14 andlack the expression of krt13 and krt20 activation of pparÎ in these cells induced theexpression of krt13 and decreased the expression of krt14 this effect was significantlyenhanced when

authors have declaredthat no competing interests existthe tumor microenvironment is composed of the surrounding stromal cells such as endothelialcells in blood vessels immune cells fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix ecm [ ] during carcinogenesis is often perturbed and deregulated while during embryonic development isstrictly controlled to maintain homeostasis   in tumors the composition of the ecm differsfrom that of normal tissue and enables new interactions that affect the function of cancer cellsand are critical in modulating invasion associated with cell migration and growth the tumorassociated ecm presents several tumorassociated antigens that are generally more abundant one  101371 pone0237889 august     one 0cdownregulation of tenascinc inhibits breast cancer cells developmentand possibly more stable than those of the cell surface [] consequently these proteins represent possible valuable targets for tumor imaging and therapy [ ] ecm proteins such as fibronectin fn and tenascin have isoforms that are expressed in a tissue specific manner generatedby alternative splicing of their primary transcripts one of the most consistent isoform changesin the ecm of many tumors is the upregulation of the glycoprotein tenascinc tnc tncalongside tenascinx tnx tenascinr tnr and tenascinw tnn are members of wellconserved among vertebrates tenascin family tn [] numerous isoforms of tnc can beproduced through alternative splicing of nine fibronectin type iii regions between repeats  and at the premrna level there is a considerable amount of literature on the contribution of different splicingdependent tnc domains in specific biological functions   changes in thetnc isoforms expression pattern have been then described in a number of malignancies andtheir nature appears to be tumortype specific recent studies have demonstrated that somesplice variants are specific to diseased tissues [] in breast tissues expression of two tncvariants one containing domain d and the other both b and d was found to be associated withinvasive phenotype   tnc promotes cell migration angiogenesis inhibit focal contact formation and also act as a cell survival factor [] its importance was found in the development and progression of different types of neoplasm including colon and breast cancerfibrosarcoma lung cancer melanoma squamous cell carcinoma bladder cancer and prostaticadenocarcinoma [ ] tnc is also highly expressed in highgrade gliomas which correlatesas well with the invasiveness of glioma cells [] in the brain it is important for the development of neural stem cells [ ] and moreover is suspected to be a potential marker for glioblastoma multiforme gbm stem cells gsc  previously we have shown that tnc is overexpressed in gbm and can be a good target inrnai approach with 164nt long dsrna complementary to the mrna of tnc which wecalled atnrna we conducted the experimental therapy for gbm patients   the discoverythat tnc presents a dominant epitope in glioblastoma prompted us to investigate the potentialof atnrna to block the tnc expression and its effect on the growth of human breast cancers where tnc overexpression was also established and linked with the highest malignancyinvasion capability and metastasis ability this view is supported by mock   who showedthat gbm patients with antibodies against the egflike repeats of tnc antibody targetvcedgftgpdcae have a significantly better prognosis than other patients   thus weassumed that in the light of the satisfactory results of brain tumors

seem to be irrelevant for breast cancer wedid not perform any further analysiswith ppisurv portal we looked through the transcriptomic data to correlate the tncexpression with the different clinical parameters such as survival or prognosis of the canceras the initial step of analysis we performed the alignment of tnc and other proteins from thetenascin family such as tenascinx tnx looking for the

breast cancer cells developmenta role in cell to cell or cellmatrix attachment most probably inhibiting the cells migration inapproach with atnrna it seems that tnc in breast cancer cell line plays an antiadhesiverole which would affect the cell migration and invasion ability in addition to emt processesthus tnc downregulation seems to enhances the adhesiveness of cancer cells showing thedirect involvement of tnc in cell adhesive properties targeting the tnc in potential therapymight be also highly beneficial since it has been already established that tnc maintain a stemcell niche in the brain tumors thus could promote the tumor cell invasion therefore its overexpression largely contributes to radiochemotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence infact it has been shown that targeting gbm invasion increases tumor sensitivity to temozolomide   tnc also promotes stromal events such as the angiogenic switch and the formationof more but leaky blood vessels involving wnt signaling and inhibition of dickkopf1 dkk1in a neuroendocrine tumor model  we observed significant atnrnamediated downregulation of tnc was in concordance with the observed changes in proliferation and migration rates the results show thatthe atnrna transfected cells lose their ability to migrate thus showing the involvement oftnc in breast cancer invasiveness our data indicate also that the downregulation of tncexpression in mdamb231 cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation along with induction of celldeath we were able to determine the tnc impact on the apoptosis by measuring level of bothcaspases initiating intracellular events caspase2   and effector caspases3  and orend     demonstrated that tnc causes cdk2 inactivation and blocks cell cycle progression from g1 phase to s phase of anchoragedependent fibroblasts by interfering withfibronectinsyndecan4 interactions for the proliferation of anchoragedependent cellsattachment to the ecm is required detachment of fibroblasts by a pure tenascinc substratum results in g1phase arrest by inactivation of the cdk2 complex in a ckidependent manner   in contrast to fibroblasts proliferation of most tumor cells is stimulated by tnc  this shows that the effect of tnc on proliferation is cell typespecific and suggests that in cancer cells the cdk2 complex is not repressed in the presence of tnc in leukemia breast carcinoma and glioma were found subpopulations of stemlike cells that support tumor growth  in such cells adhesion on the tnc substratum may override the g0g1 and gls cellcycle checkpoints which may explain the increased proliferation rate   the g1s transitionis enforced by cyclin ecdk2 activation via syndecan4 related signalling it has been shownthat tnc in tumor cells binds to the syndecan4 binding site in fibronectin thereby blockingsyndecan4 ligation releasing the tumor cells from the suppressive effect of fibronectin ontheir proliferation   this would a

access should be considered alongside intravenous therapy for hydration inolder adults and several medications there are additional benefits in terms of ease of useand costeffectiveness of this mode inclusion of subcutaneous access in clinical guidelinesmay promote uptake of this route to help preserve vessel health of vulnerable patients further highquality research is needed to inform subcutaneous infusion therapy in a variety ofpopulations including pediatrics and palliative care and medications and clarifying themechanism of deliveryintroductioninfusion therapy is a common treatment modality to deliver medications and fluids in theacute and home care settings and is gaining prevalence in the longterm care setting traditionally these parenteral therapies have been delivered via the intravenous route howevervenous depletion is a growing concern with an increasing aging population and patients withlongterm complex comorbidities [] the problems of venous depletion are compoundedby unnecessary peripheral venipuncture which add to patient physical and psychologicaltrauma compromised intravenousrelated outcomes suboptimal use of healthcare resourcesand increased costs [ ] additionally infusion therapy is moving beyond the boundariesof the acute care and home care sector to hospices and longterm care facilities   recentlypublished vascular access planning tools are either oriented primarily to the acute care settingor do not address the option of subcutaneous access [ ]the infusion therapy standards of practice recommend consideration of subcutaneousaccess for the administration of isotonic solutions and for continuous opioid and other infusion therapiesmedications eg immunoglobulin therapy   subcutaneous access isachieved through the placement of a small catheter in the subcutaneous tissue with the infusate absorbed from this space into the circulatory system this route has the advantages ofrequiring a small catheter and less technical insertion skills than that used for intravenousaccess with its ease of application lending to its use in multiple settings   additionallytime to place the catheter is less and fewer complications are likely resulting in cost benefits[ ] although practiced since  there has been a slow uptake in part due to a lack offamiliarity with the technique among physicians and healthcare professionals and perceivedsuboptimal outcomes eg hypovolemic shock due to inappropriate use of hydration solutions [ ] in our scoping literature search to prepare for a systematic review of primarystudies numerous systematic reviews were identified however each either had a narrowscope addressing one treatment eg fisher and colleagues review of iron overload management   or provided limited literature search or limited evidence eg duemsnoreiga andblascos   review of subcutaneous fluid and drug deliverygiven the worlds aging population health care systems rapidly changing diversity in practice setting and complexity of care and patient health conditions the uptake and use of subcutaneous continuous infusions may help address these issues and challenges the aim of ourstudy is to determine the effectiveness safety acceptability and efficiency related to the use ofsubcutaneous infusion sci as an alternate route to intravenous for the management of conditions or treatments such as dehydration and palliation for children and adults in all care settings through a synthesis of systematic reviews of studies a secondary objective is to identify one  101371

elsewhere to improve cod reporting systemsintroductiona key source of evidence for targeting health interventions to improve population health ishigh quality cause of death cod data that reliably document trends in mortality for differentdiseases and injuries   however several studies have demonstrated that policy and practicein many countries are based on data that are far from accurate [] in order to target effortsto improve the utility of cod data for policy it is important to first understand what the keydiagnostic errors area major problem with cod data is poor cause of death certification practices that result ingarbage codes ie codes that provide little or no information about the true underlying causeof death   garbage codes include what are often called illdefined causes but encompass alarger universe of uninformative diagnoses the major consequence of garbage codes is thatthey obscure the true mortality pattern in a population for example if a death certificate onlystates septicemia as the cause of death there is no way of knowing whether this resulted forexample from an infected wound following an accident from a postoperative amputationdue to diabetes or from meningitis or pneumonia each of which would require different preventive strategies if the underlying cause that led to septicemia is not indicated on the deathcertificate public policy to prevent these deaths would be misinformed potentially leading toinefficient resource allocation to prevent themcod data provide the essential health intelligence for health policies across countries atvarious levels of socioeconomic development our premise is that a better understanding ofgarbage codes ie their levels and patterns in countries at different stages of socioeconomicdevelopment will help to target improvements in cod reporting systems in this study weinvestigate whether the usability of cod data and the patterns of garbage codes are related toa countrys socioeconomic development using the anaconda software tool [  s1 file]to assess the quality of  national cod datasets several countries have used this tool to assesshow fit for purpose their data are [] but there has not been any crosscountry analysis ofdata quality across a range of socioeconomic development levels and cod reporting systemsusing the common anaconda frameworkthe implication of our findings for public policy to improve population health is that if therelationship is found to be very weak or nonexistent then efforts to improve national civilregistration and vital statistics systems can expect to make significant progress towardsimproving the evidence base for policy without depending on further socioeconomicdevelopmentdata and methodswe carried out a crosssectional study using publicly available data from the who mortalitydatabase   which contains cod data reported by its member states the  countries one  101371 pone0237539 august     one 0care

middle sdi and  high sdi countrieson the basis of the country specific icd10 codes used in gbd    the most severecertification and coding errors that can mislead policy and public health planning were identified and categorized into four groups the fourtier garbage code typology used in anaconda is based on the premise that some garbage codes are worse than others depending onhow serious their impact is for guiding or misguiding policy debates and will thus likely impactdisease and injury control strategies differently  ¢ level  very highcodes with serious policy implications these are causes for which thetrue underlying cod could in fact belong to any of three broad cause group ie it is impossible to establish whether the true cause was a communicable disease a noncommunicabledisease or because of an injury a good example being septicaemia reported as the underlying cause of death these are the most serious misdiagnoses among the universe of unusable codes since they could potentially grossly misinform understanding of the extent ofepidemiological transition in the population¢ level  highcodes with substantial implications for policy these are causes for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to belong to one or two of the three broad cause groupsfor example essential primary hypertension¢ level  mediumcodes with important implications for policy these are causes forwhich the true underlying cod is likely to be within the same icd chapter for exampleunspecified cancer and thus are of some policy value¢ level  lowcodes with limited implications for policy these are diagnoses for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to be confined to a single disease or injury category egunspecified stroke would still be assigned as a stroke death and not to some other diseasecategory the implications of unusable causes classified at this level will therefore be muchless important for public policy but a more specific code would have increased their utilityfor specific public health analysesa full list of the composition of specific icd10 garbage codes for each of the four severitylevels is given in s2 filegiven the considerable differences in population age structure between countries at highand low levels of socioeconomic development we age standardised the pattern of garbagecodes the point of agestandardising was to investigate whether countries with a comparatively old age structure and hence relatively high average age at death might expect to have agreater fraction of garbage codes simply because of the higher likelihood of multiple comorbidity in the elderly we used the global age distribution of deaths from the latest gbd studyas the standard   one  101371 pone0237539 august     one 0care cause of death data fit for purposein addition to diagnostic accuracy the ability of any dataset to describe the true mortalitypattern in a population also depends on how complete it is both in terms of capturing alldeaths that occur and in assigning each a cod completeness of the cod reporting ie thepercentage of actual deaths in a population that are assigned a cod for each of the  countries was calculated using the adairlopez empirical method incorporated into anaconda  the empirical method models the relationship between the crude death rate cdr andits principal determinants namely the age structure of the population and the overall level ofmortality as reflected by the level of child mortality the predicted cdr based on these inputvariables for a population is then compared with the observed cdr to estimate death registration completeness given that the model was built largely from historical data where the levelsof adult mortality and child mortality are closely correlated the predictions of completenessfor populations where this assumption is not valid such as those severely affected by hivshould be interpreted cautiouslydatasets that are both incomplete and have a high proportion of garbage codes provide limited insight into the true health status of a population we combined the proportion of unrecorded deaths with the amount of garbage codes to provide a summary measure of the utilityof the data for policy this indicator is particularly important when investigating data qualityin countries with low completeness where the data available may only come from hospitalsand other health facilities where diagnostic facilities and physician availability is greaterpotentially overstating the policy utility of the dataa key output of any mortality surveillance system is a table showing the leading causes ofdeath for the population in countries where garbage codes are commonly assigned they frequently appear among the  or  leading causes and can seriously impact the overall utilityof the cod data this is particularly the case when they permeate the top  leading causesand are high impact providing little or no useful information for policythe anaconda software tool specifically developed for assessing quality of mortalityand cod data was used to investigate each dataset s1 file to identify the pattern and extentof garbage codes in the data their frequency among the leading causes the completeness ofthe dataset and to provide an overall summary index of the quality of the output of the mortality data system namely the vital statistics performance index for quality vspiq  resultsthe proportion of garbage codes in the  country datasets varied substantially by countryranging from  to  see fig  while the relationship between sdi and amount of garbage codes in the data is broadly apparent the relatively low r2  arises from the presenceof outliers particularly uzbekistan kyrgyzstan nicaragua and colombia it is quite possiblethat specific certification and coding procedures have been introduced in these countries toavoid the use of garbage codes if these countries are omitted the strength of the inverse relationship is much more apparent further insights into the general characteristics of populationand mortality of the selected countries can be found in s2 filethe mean values for each sdi group indicate that on average countries of high sdi statushad a lower  proportion of garbage codes in their data than middle  and low sdi countries table  interestingly there was large intercountry variation in theuse of garbage codes within each sdi

postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity  for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ ] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity  evenfor subcentimeter lesions  [] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [] The American Society of

CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore DIAPANC will contribute to our knowledge ofliver metastases regarding incidence

oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   ] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  ] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these

prostate cancer tissues The expressionlevels of RNAs were monitored via qRTPCR Western blot evaluated the levels of proteins The proliferationapoptosis and migration of prostate cancer cells were assessed by CCK8 EdU TUNEL Transwell and woundhealing assays Luciferase reporter RNA pull down and RIP assays were applied to detect the interplays amongLINC00992 miR3935 and GOLM1Results Elevated

characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFÎ±induced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples

expression in the prostate cancer cells and RWPE1 cells was evaluated by qRTPCRConsequently higher level of LINC00992 was exhibitedin prostate cancer cells than that in RWPE1 cells Fig1b which was

And then thedata from CCK8 assay revealed that LINC00992 depletion suppressed the proliferation of DU145 and PC3cells Fig 1d As expected a declined proportion ofEdU positive cells was observed after knocking downLINC00992 Fig 1e suggesting the suppressive effect ofLINC00992 deficiency on prostate cancer cell proliferation Additionally the expression levels of proliferationrelated proteins PCNA

furtherverified the abundance of LINC00992 in the cytoplasmof prostate cancer cells Fig 2bc highlighting a posttranscriptional control of LINC00992 in such cellsHence we speculated that LINC00992 might act as aceRNA in prostate cancer regulation According toDIANAlncBase the top three potential miRNAs possessing the binding capacity with LINC00992 were listedFig 2d To targetthe highlymatched miRNA toLINC00992 qRTPCR analysis was conducted to testthe expression changes of these miRNAs following eitherLINC00992 depletion or augmentation The resultsdemonstrated that only miR3935 expression was increased by LINC00992 depletion Fig 2e but reducedby LINC00992 overexpression in the meantime Fig 2fThus miR3935 was chosen for further analysis Afterwards RNA pull down assay was implemented and theresult depicted that LINC00992 was pulled down byBiomiR3935WT Fig 2g which indicated the bindingof LINC00992 and miR3935 Later we observed thesatisfactory efficiency of miR3935 overexpression

the bindingsites between LINC00992 and miR3935 were predictedat first and then data from luciferase reporter assayrevealed that miR3935 upregulation decreased theluciferase activity of LINC00992WT

the expression of GOLM1 a targetof miR3935Present evidence has suggested that miRNAs can bindwith downstream target genes to inhibit their expressionHerein we searched the miR3935 target genes andeight mRNAs were found out Subsequently we detectedtheir expression in prostate cancer cells and normalcells Interestingly we found that only Golgi membraneprotein  GOLM1 was highly expressed in four prostate cancer cell lines relative to normal controls Fig 3aFurther we discovered that GOLM1 expression wasmarkedly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues according to data from GEPIA database Fig 3b SimilarlyGOLM1 expression was much higher in prostate cancertissue samples than in peritumor samples Figure S3AIn addition the mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in contrastto RWPE1 cells Fig 3c Figure S3B Besides GOLM1has been previously revealed as a prostate cancer facilitator and was metastasisrelated in prostate tumor [] Thus we hypothesized that GOLM1 might act asthe downstream of LINC00992miR3935 signaling inprostate cancer Through TargetScan httpwwwtargetscanvert_72 the binding site between GOLM1and miR3935 was predicted Fig 3d After conductingluciferase reporter assay in DU145 and PC3 cells weobserved that upregulation of miR3935 specifically decreased the luciferase activity of GOLM1WT reporterFig 3e confirming the interaction between miR3935and GOLM1 relied on the putative binding sites Thenwe unveiled that GOLM1 mRNA and protein levels wereboth reduced by LINC00992 inhibition or miR3935upregulation according to qRTPCR and western blotanalyses Fig 3fg Figure S3C Moreover data fromRIP assay unveiled the binding of miR3935 to GOLM1in the RISCs Fig 3h Further we demonstrated thatthe decreased mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1 induced by LINC00992 depletion could be restored afterinhibiting miR3935 expression Fig 3ij Figure S3DAll the results showed that LINC00992 upregulatedGOLM1 expression via directly binding to

Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ¥  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin

years the incidence of primary malignant brain tumors has increased at an annual rate of  with an especially higher rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years  years  years  yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers

criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were  years old pediatric groupand  years old youth group  years oldmiddleaged group and ¥  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged  years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced the understanding of glioma pathogenesis and have identified several prognostic factorsHigher tumor grade older age [] and increased expression of molecular biomarkers such as P53 []MGMT [] PR [] IDH1wildtype [] H3K27Mmutation of pediatric HGG [ ] and Ki67 []were related to poorer prognoses Analysis of the pathological molecular markers

and objectiveparameters that can be collected easily in clinical practice or clinical studies on patients with glioma Our research can provide clinicians with a simple method toevaluate the prognosis of glioma patients and help topromote the personalized management of glioma patients In addition for some clinical trials that need todivide participants of glioma into different groups thisage group classification based on WHO grade will bemore objective However this study was limited by thesample size and these data were retrospective Hospitalbased retrospective studies may lead to certain selectionbiases Another limitation of this study was that we didnot include patients with postoperative recurrence Further validation of our results will require multicenterprospective studies with

about the characteristics ofdementia caregivers sleep and the factors that may influence sleep disruptionThe purpose of this study was to investigate the sleep characteristics and disturbances of Australian caregivers of aperson living with dementia In addition it evaluated the psychological wellbeing of caregivers by evaluatingassociations between mood and sleep in this populationMethods This study used a crosssectional descriptive correlation design Participants were recruited with theassistance of Alzheimers Australia Dementia Australia and targeted social media advertising In total  adultprimary informal caregivers of people with dementia participated completing a questionnaire on demographiccharacteristics the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale DASS21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQIResults In this study  of caregivers were female who had been caring for someone living with dementia onaverage for  years  of participants had two or more comorbidities namely cardiovascular disease osteoarthritisand diabetes  of participants were poor sleepers with  with difficulty initiating sleep and  reporting havingdifficulty maintaining sleep Overall psychological distress was common with high levels of moderate to severedepression anxiety and stress Global PSQI scores were significantly positively associated with depression and anxietywith the strongest correlation seen with stress scores Depression scores were also moderately associated with daytimedysfunction Stress was identified as a significant predictor of overall sleep qualityConclusions Sleep problems are common within the population of dementia caregivers Due to the nature andduration of caregiving and the progression of dementia of the care recipient there is the potential for a decline in thecaregivers mental and physical health Caregivers of those living with dementia are more likely to have comorbiditiesdepression anxiety and stress Sleep quality is correlated with emotional

communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults ¥ years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregivers own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the

reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent

interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure

explains theneed for specific and adapted care [ ] Neverthelessscientific data are scarce because older subjects are oftenunderrepresented in oncological clinical trials that setthe standards of antineoplastic treatment [ ]Over the last three decades the fiveyear survival ratefor all types of cancer has increased particularly in individuals aged  to  [ ] Still older patients are atmore risk of toxicity in anticancer therapies such aschemotherapy and require a benefitrisk assessmentprior to treatment [] A comprehensive geriatric assessment CGA is consequently recommended in these patients to diagnose comorbidities and optimize geriatricinterventions and to improve the functional state andpossibly the survival rate by ensuring better tolerance totreatment [ ] CGA has also shown predictive valuein identifying elderly patients with cancer who are exposed to a poor prognosisincluding a higher risk ofdeath during hospitalization [] Among the CGAbased assessment tools the

interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider

to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworlds older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged ¥ yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV  two algorithms which determine an individualscurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between

concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than    CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed    CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than    CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less

accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  ] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow

an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that  of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated

              "      <th>the periparturient period is one of the most challenging periods in dairy cows and encompasses the  a0wk prior to and  a0wk after parturition  the  nutrient  requirements  of  dairy  cows  change greatly during this time largely due to the exponential growth of the gravid uterus and fetus followed by the demands of lactation nrc  inflammation oxidative stress and adipose tissue mobilization  lead  to  a  reduction  in  dry  matter  intake  dmi during the periparturient period this reduction in dmi leads to a negative nutrient balance nnb with a shortfall in the nutrient availability  for  the  cow  and  fetus  ingvartsen  and  andersen   additionally  this  reduction  in  dmi  also  increases  the risk of metabolic ketosis fatty liver milk fever and immunerelated disorders the risk of these diseases poor reproduction and low efficiency is greatly impacted by the degree and length of time during which these systems metabolism and immune response remain out of balance loor et a0al 2013a much of the research  over  the  last  decade  have  examined  these  biological interactions to identify the mechanisms behind the metabolic physiologic  and  immune  adaptations  that  occur  during  the periparturient period loor et a0al 2013a 2013b roche et a0al  bradford et a0al it  is  now  known  that  nutrients  such  as  amino  acids  aa serve  functional  roles  outside  of  their  use  as  building  blocks for  proteins  and  have  immunomodulatory  properties  and interact through common biochemical pathways eg 1carbon metabolism  figure a0   this  concept  has  been  well  explored in  nonruminant  species  li  et a0 al    sikalidis    with nutritional  management  during  the  periparturient  period continuing  to  be  an  active  area  of  research  it  is  important  to develop a system understanding the potential immunometabolic role  that  dietary  aa  may  play  during  this  period  thus  the objective of this review is to provide an overview of physiological adaptations  during  the  periparturient  period  the  immune system and methods to assess immune function and oxidative stress this will be followed by a more specific discussion of the immunometabolic roles of specific aa and their potential effects in  dairy  cow  during  the  periparturient  period  the  potential effects  of  enhanced  aa  supply  during  the  preweaning  period will also be discussed brieflybiological adaptations in the transition cowa brief overviewduring  the  nnb  associated  with  the  periparturient  period biological

been  well  established  that  these  responses  are  mediated  by the  proinflammatory  cytokines  interleukin  il6  il1  and tumor necrosis factorÎ± tnfÎ± kindt et a0al  additionally oxidative  stress  also  occurs  during  this  period  and  is  driven by  the  imbalance  between  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen metabolites  rom  reactive  nitrogen  species  rns  and  the neutralizing

eg  signal  transducer and  activator  of  transcription    [stat3]  nuclear  factorkappa b  [nfÎºb] the  increase  in  oxidative  stress  and  inflammation during this period is also negatively associated with a reduction in  liver  functionality  and  measurement  of  app  can  provide a  useful  tool  to  assess  liver  function  as  well  as  inflammation bertoni and trevisi during  the  periparturient  period  aa  metabolism  is  also altered  with  moderate  carcass  protein  losses  reported  even when animals are fed to their predicted metabolizable protein requirements  bell  et a0 al    additionally  circulating  aa concentrations  change  dramatically  with  favorable  circulating profiles  of  many aa  not  being  restored  until    d  postpartum zhou et a0al 2016b furthermore the total concentration of aa in plasma reaches a nadir around day  postpartum zhou et a0al 2016b which corresponds to a peak in total disease incidence during  early  lactation  ingvartsen    this  decrease  in circulating  aa  is  likely  associated  with  the  increased  use  of aa  for  gluconeogenesis  as  well  as  for  hepatic  production  of app thus it is important to investigate how supplemental aa during  the  periparturient  period  may  modulate  metabolism and  immune  responses  to  promote  production  and  reduce susceptibility to diseasegeneral overview of the immune a0systemthe immune system consists of both the adaptive and innate immune responses which are linked together through signaling molecules  such  as  cytokines  the  innate  immune  system  is the  first  line  of  defense  and  includes  physical  barriers  such as  epithelial  cell  layers  that  express  tight  cell  junctions  and the  mucus  layer  of  the  respiratory  gastrointestinal  and genitourinary tracts chaplin  cells involved in the innate immune  response  include  macrophages  polymorphonuclear neutrophils  pmn  dendritic  cells  mast  cells  eosinophils natural killer cells and natural killer t cells turvey and broide  the  focus  of  the  present  review  is  on  the  effects  of aa on  phagocytic  cells  that  is  cells  that  engulf  and  kill  such  as macrophages  and  pmn  macrophages  not  only  phagocytose invading pathogens but also produce cytokines such as ils and tnfÎ±  which  initiate  innate  and  adaptive  immune  responses and recruit pmn to the site of infection chaplin the  adaptive  immune  response  consists  of t  lymphocytes b  lymphocytes  and  humoral  factors  marshall  et a0 al   there  are  two  types  of t  lymphocytes  cytotoxic t  cells  cd8 cells and thelper th cells cd4 cells marshall et a0al  cytotoxic t  cells  detect  and  eliminate  infected  cells  while th cells produce ils and interferonÎ³ ingvartsen and moyes  the b lymphocytes are cells that produce antibodies that bind to  antigens  on  the  surface  of  pathogens  to  mark  them  for destruction marshall et a0al  0ccoleman et a0al   s177aa immune function and oxidative a0stressduring  the  periparturient  period  the  metabolic  status  is associated with the inflammatory regulation of peripheral blood mononuclear  cells  with  a  more  pronounced  inflammatory response in those cells during the nnb immediately postpartum agrawal  et a0 al    mann  et a0 al    this  period  is  also associated  with  altered  signaling  of  nutrientsensing  kinases in  immune  cells  such  as  the  protein  kinase  b  akt  and mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  mtor  pathway  which  may modulate cytokine production mann et a0al  aa can directly and indirectly alter the immune system besides being used in energy metabolism reactions and the synthesis of proteins aa are critical for the synthesis of other functional molecules such as the antioxidants gsh and taurine no histamine and hydrogen peroxide  li  et a0 al   thus  this  section  of  the  review  will focus on the role that aa play in modulating immune function and  oxidative  stress  in  dairy  cows  during  the  periparturient period a a0special focus will be placed on aa involved in 1carbon metabolism as this represents an interconnected route through which  aa  could  impact  molecular  events  such  as  epigenetic regulation  protein  synthesis  via  mtor  energy  metabolism and antioxidant synthesis a a0summary of studies investigating the  effects  of aa  on  immune  function  and  oxidative  stress  in dairy cows is provided in table a0 a a0summary model of how aa might alter immune function and oxidant status is depicted in figure

of interest to increase circulating concentrations of met for its functional roles in the body the  work  from  dalbach  et a0 al    demonstrated  that rumenprotected  met  rpm  can  be  used  to  increase  serum concentrations  of  met  in  the  first  2wk  postpartum  which will  enhance  the  availability  of  met  for  protein  synthesis  and metabolism via the 1carbon pathways in terms of production supplementation  of  met  during the  peripartal  period concomitantly  increases  milk  yield  milk  protein  and  milk fat  soon  after  calving  ordway  et a0 al    osorio  et a0 al   these  responses  are  in  large  part  driven  by  enhancing  met availability  and  by  the  additional  flux  of  met  through  the  met cycle in the liver which consequently increases the production of downstream compounds such as sam pc gsh and taurine additionally work feeding rpm during the periparturient period has detected positive responses in maintaining consistent rates of dmi

indicated  that  insulin  sensitivity  of  the  mammary gland was enhanced with supplemental met ma et a0al  in subcutaneous adipose tissue the mrna and protein abundance of  some  aa  transporters  and  pmtor  were  upregulated  with enhanced  met  supply  while  changes  in  insulin  signaling  and plasma glucose also indicated that met helped improve insulin sensitivity  liang  et a0 al  2019b  thus  enhancing  met  supply during  the  periparturient  period  may  lead  to  mtor  activation in  immune  cells  as  well  as  improved  nutrient  uptake  which could help to support

complex mechanisms are also likelyinvolved in the dxr resistance in cd44cd133 cells discussionby using the wellrecognized cell surface markers of cd44and cd133 for csc identiï¬cation we tried to separate thehct8 human colon cancer cells into cd44 cd44 cd44cd133 and cd44cd133 subpopulations and then investigated how the expressions of cd44 and cd133 associatedwith drug resistance actually we checked several cancer celllines on the expression of cd44 and cd133 including helacells and a549 cells however both hela cells and a549 cellsshowed almost  expression of cd44 only the hct8cells showed a partial expression of cd44 about  anda rare expression of cd133 therefore we only isolateddiï¬erent subpopulations from hct8 cells for this studyfirst we found that the expression level of cd44 keptvery stable in the cd44cd133 cells but gradually declinedin cd44cd133 cells during a cell passaging process on theother hand some of cd44 cells shifted to express cd44 during a cell passaging process figure 1c these ï¬ndings suggested the plasticity of cd44 expression in hct8 cellsactually ohata et al reported that cd44 highexpressedcells from human intractable colon cancer patients can diï¬erentiate into cd44 lowexpressed cells and a fraction of cd44lowexpressed cells can also generate cd44 highexpressedcells in a xenograft mouse model   however it is unclearwhy the cd44cd133 cells but not cd44cd133 cellsstably maintain the expression level of cd44 unlike theextensive expression of cd44 with high plasticity the expression of cd133 was only observed in very few of the hct8cells with poor plasticitya number of previous studies have demonstrated thatcscs are likely resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thecd44cd133 cells but not the cd44 and cd44cd133cells showed dxr resistance figure 2a according to thisdata the expression of cd133 but not cd44 seems to beclosely associated with drug resistance actuallythesecd44cd133 cells showed the enhanced expression ofabcb1 and the decreased intracellular accumulation ofdxr figures 2b and 2c liu et al reported that nonsmallcell lung cancer cells treated with lowdose cddp aresuï¬cient to enrich cd133 cells and upregulate abcb1expression through notch signaling which thereforeincreases the crossresistance to dxr   however theinhibition of abcb1 by verapamil only partially improvedthe dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells in this studyto ï¬nd other potential mechanisms involving in thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells we investigatedseveral interesting aspects including the stress protectionand redox regulation we found that p38mapk one of themost popular protein kinases known to be activated byinï¬ammatory cytokines lipopolysaccharide osmotic shockultraviolet light and other stresses was more obviouslyinduced by dxr in cd44cd133 cells than cd44cd133cells figure  moreover the activation of p38 mapk wasnot dependent on the intracellular accumulation of dxrfigure dxr is known to insert between the base pairs of dna oftumor cells and exhibits antitumor eï¬ects by suppressing thebiosynthesis of both dna and rna through the inhibitionof dna polymerase rna polymerase and topoisomeraseii reactions furthermore it is believed that dxr has theability to generate suï¬cient ros to raise oxidative stressindeed we observed dxrinduced ros generation in bothcd44cd133 and cd44cd133 cells butthe dxrinduced ros generation was detected even higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells independent on the intracellular accumulation of dxr figures 5a 2b and 3bsuggesting the enhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsthe keap1nrf2 control system plays a central role in theantioxidant defense mechanisms nrf2 is known as a transcription factor to activate various genes involving in biological defense mechanisms it has been reported that nrf2 isconstantly expressed in many cancer cells [] moreover the enhanced expression of nrf2 has been conï¬rmedto associate with poor prognosis of cancer patients []in our study nrf2 expression was detected higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells and the diï¬erence in nrf2expression was observed even clearer between cells with dxradministrationindependent on the dxr accumulationfigure 5b these ï¬ndings also clearly indicate theenhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsalthough the absence of direct evidence by interferenceexperiment pathways involving in the stress protection andredox regulation might at least partially contributed to thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsvery strangely our data showed that the silencing ofcd133 expression in cd44cd133 cells by sirna couldonly partially increase the cytotoxicity of dxr figure 6bbut did not change the expression of abcb1 and the intracellular accumulation of dxr figure 6c other unknownmechanisms beyond the drug excretion and redox regulationare asked to be deï¬ned on the dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsbased on data from the present study the expression ofcd133 rather than cd44 more closely associated with theresistance of cancer cells to anticancer drug as complexmechanisms including the drug excretion and redox regulation are likely involved in the drug resistance of cscs multiple

ppar alpha also functions in fatty acidbetaoxidation and vascular ammation   ppar gammaacts as a regulator in adipocyte diï¬erentiation and type  diabetes   ppar betadelta is a key player in cardiac energyproduction angiogenesis and particularly in cancer progression  ppar alpha and ppar gamma exert predominantly anantiangiogenic eï¬ect [] but there still exist conï¬ictingstudies showing opposite results [ ] on the contraryppar betadelta produces more obviously proangiogeniceï¬ects [] in this review we will focus on the promotingrole of ppar betadelta in angiogenesis especially in tumorangiogenesis the network of interplay between ppar betadelta and its various downstream signal molecules and alsobetween those key molecules will be further discussed andestablished remarkably diverse important signal moleculesinvolved in tumor angiogenesis and progression and cancercell metabolism have been identiï¬ed as direct ppar betadelta target genes angiogenesisangiogenesis is the physiological process through which anew capillary network forms from the preexisting vasculature[ ] whereas vasculogenesis denotes de novo bloodvessel formation mostly during embryogenesis in whichendothelial progenitor cells epc migrate to sites of vascularization then diï¬erentiate into endothelial cells ec andcoalesce into the initial vascular plexus [ ] besides theinteraction between proangiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors angiogenesis is also a multiple step biologicalprocess during which a variety of molecules cooperateincluding cell adhesion molecules matrix metalloproteinases 0cppar researchmmps extracellular matrix ecm and basement membrane componentsangiogenesis is a physiological and vital process in development and growth an imbalance of proangiogenic andantiangiogenic factors causes angiogenesis in pathologicalconditions such as diabetic retinopathy and tumor growththus when the imbalance comes to a point at which angiogenesis is triggered by tumor cells then an angiogenicswitch of tumor cells is turned on during tumor progression the angiogenic switch is often activated and remainson [] inducing angiogenesis is known as a hallmarkof cancer   and angiogenesis is also a fundamental stepby which most benign tumors transition into malignant ones tumor angiogenesis tumor needs to sprout new vesselsand further develop a vascular network in order to supplynutrients and oxygen remove waste products support a continually high proliferative rate and ultimately expand neoplastic growth [ ] hence angiogenesis is essential forhelping sustain tumor growth and facilitate tumor progression besides being a requirement for angiogenesis an abnormal vasculature also helps to promote tumor progression andmetastasis the tumor vascular wall is imperfect and prone toleakage so it is much easier for tumor cells to directly penetrate into the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and then proliferate at another distant site to form metastasis  due to intensive abnormal neovascularization in tumortissues most malignant tumors grow rapidly and acquirethe ability to spread to adjacent and distant ans whichmakes them more malignant and even life threateningtherefore angiogenesis indeed plays an important role intumor progression and metastasis and to intervene with thisprocess would obviously prevent tumor development andspread thus this has been regarded as a critical target forantitumor therapy ppar alpha and angiogenesisit was reported ï¬rstly that a selective ppar alpha agonistwy14643 did not show any eï¬ect on angiogenesis or ec proliferation   but some subsequent studies showed that theactivation of ppar alpha inhibited angiogenesis in vitro byusing fenoï¬brate a clinically used ppar alpha agonist  moreover fenoï¬brate suppressed ec proliferation migration and tube formation through inhibition of protein kinaseb akt and disruption of the cytoskeleton   furthermore ppar alpha activation was shown to inhibit vascularendothelial growth factor vegf induced ec migrationand basic ï¬broblast growth factor bfgffgf2 inducedcorneal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo   especiallyin vivo reduced tumor growth and microvessel numberswere observed in mice implanted with melanoma lewis lungcarcinoma llc ï¬brosarcoma and glioblastoma due to asystemic treatment of ppar alpha ligand and the antiangiogenic state induced through activation of ppar alpha withelevated thrombospondin1 tsp1 and endostatin expression  howeverit was demonstrated inanother observation that activation of ppar alpha stimuin that same yearlated neovascularization in vivo with increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos and akt via avegfdependent manner   furthermore zhang andward also suggested that ppar alpha activation inducedproangiogenic responses in human ocular cells   inanother study it was shown that a new ppar alpha agonistrk13675 had no eï¬ect on angiogenesis   recentlyppar alpha activation is further shown to have antineovascularization eï¬ects with downregulation of vegf and angiopoietin expression in a rat alkali burn model  in summary the role of ppar alpha in angiogenesis isstill controversial some observations showed that ligandactivation of ppar alpha had antiangiogenic eï¬ects mediated either through upregulation of antiangiogenic factorssuch as tsp1 and endostatin or downregulation of proangiogenic factors including vegf fgf2 akt and angiopoietins others also reported opposite results showing aproangiogenic role upon ppar alpha activation thus thespeciï¬c molecular mechanism is still unclear and needs tobe further studied ppar gamma and angiogenesisligand activation of ppar gamma was previously shown toinhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cell huvec tubeformation in collagen gels   and vegfinduced choroidalneovascularization in vitro and in vivo   another studyalso demonstrated that ec apoptosis was induced throughtreatment with the ppar gamma ligand 15dpgj2   furthermore rosiglitazone a potent ppar gamma agonist wasshown to inhibit primary tumor growth and metastasisthrough both direct and indirect antiangiogenic

in a mouse modelwith ischemiainduced retinopathy pioglitazone a ppargamma agonist also showed a protective eï¬ect against pathological neoangiogenesis through upregulation of antiammatory adipokine

of epc in vitro andin vivo via a phosphoinositide3kinase pi3k dependentmanner  nadra   observed that ppar gammanull embryosdisplayed a vascular structural defect at e95 moreover disanized placental layers and an altered placental microvasculature were observed in pregnant wildtype mice treatedwith the ppar gamma agonist rosiglitazone as well asreduced expression of proangiogenic factorsincludingvegf proliferin and plateletendothelial cell adhesionmolecule1 pecam1cd31   suggesting a crucial roleof ppar gamma in placental vascular development the 0cppar researchmajor antiangiogenic properties on ppar gamma activationwere also reviewed here  notablyin most cancersthe canonical wntbetacatenin pathway is upregulated while on the contrary ppargamma is downregulated interestingly in numerous tissuesthe activation of ppar gamma inhibits the betacateninpathway whereascanonicalwntbetacatenin signal cascade also inactivates ppargamma   implicating a negative regulatory role of ppargamma in carcinogenesis where tumor angiogenesis mightbe a fundamental stepstimulation ofthethein summary ppar gamma predominantly displays anantiangiogenic eï¬ect that may be mediated through the inhibition of vegf or bfgfinduced neovascularization andreduction of the expression level of some proangiogenicfactors ppar betadelta and angiogenesisunlike ppar alpha and ppar gamma on the contrarymany studies have explicitly shown the proangiogenic eï¬ectsof ppar betadelta on physiological and pathological angiogenesis the ï¬rst evidence provided in a study is that activation of ppar betadelta with gw501516 a highly selectiveppar betadelta agonistinduces huvec proliferationand an increased expression of vegf and its receptorvegfr1 flt1   besides inducing ec proliferationppar betadelta activation by itsligand prostacyclinpgi2 also stimulates upregulation of  alpha expression an antiapoptotic and antiammatory protein whichthereby protects ecs from h2o2induced apoptosis and oxidant injury   moreover a subsequent study further provides evidence that activation of ppar betadelta withgw501516 induces angiogenesis during which vegfrelease is considered as a major trigger factor   ï¬rstlysuggesting the promotion for angiogenesis upon pparbetadelta activationmÃ¼llerbrÃ¼sselbach   show that ppar betadelta mice implanted with llc and b16 melanoma exhibit diminished blood ï¬ow and immature microvascular structurescompared with wildtype mice moreover reexpression ofppar betadelta into the matrigelinvading cells triggersmicrovessel maturation and restores normal vascularization  indicating a crucial role of ppar betadelta in tumorvascularization additionally another study also observedreduced levels of calcium intracellular channel protein clic4 but it observed enhanced expression of cellular retinol binding protein  crbp1 in migrating ecs from pparbetadeltanull mice   both of which play a role in tumorvascularization [ ] it was reported that ppar betadeltawas required for placentation   and most of the pparbetadeltanull mutant embryos died at e95 to e105 due toabnormal celltocell communication atthe placentaldecidual interface   however in these studies [] adefect in angiogenesis was not observed during normal development in ppar betadeltaknockout micesome observations also show the important role of pparbetadelta in physiological angiogenesis for instance skeletal musclespeciï¬c ppar betadelta overexpression leads toppar betadeltaan increase in the number of oxidative muscle ï¬bers andrunning endurance in adult mice [] moreover pparbetadelta activation promotes a rapid muscle remodelingvia a calcineurindependent manner and induces muscleangiogenesis in highly selective ppar betadelta agonistgw0742treated animals   furthermore in the heartpharmacologicalstimulation withgw0742 induces rapid cardiac growth and cardiac angiogenesis through direct transcriptional activation of calcineurin   interestingly the same cardiac phenotype wasalso observed after treatment with the ppar betadelta agonist gw501516implicating a response speciï¬city forppar betadelta stimulation   calcineurin activationfurther leads to the stimulation of nuclear factoractivatedt cell c3 nfatc3 and an enhanced expression of hypoxiainducible factor  alpha hif1alpha and cyclindependentkinase  cdk9   overall the remodeling in skeletalmuscle and heart is perfectly the same as the phenotypeobserved with exercise and both of them are mediatedthrough activation of calcineurinppar betadelta may act as a key regulator in mediatingpathological angiogenesis for instance ppar betadelta wasshown to regulate retinal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivoand its inhibition reduced preretinal neovascularization possibly via an angiopoietinlike protein  angptl4 dependent manner  implicating the potential of pparbetadelta in modulating pathological ocular angiogenesisrecently an observation reported that ppar betadeltaknockdown in both retinal pigment epithelial and choroidalendothelial cells caused an antiangiogenic phenotype andppar betadelta promoted laserinduced choroidal neovascular cnv lesions in ppar betadelta  mice   moreover pharmacological inhibition of ppar betadelta with theantagonist gsk0660 also resulted in a signiï¬cantly decreasedcnv lesion size in vivo suggesting a functional role of pparbetadelta in the development of cnv lesions   this indicates that ppar betadelta has an important association withpathological angiogenesisangiotensin ii ang ii the biologically

ppar betadelta was further shown to inhibit angiimediated atherosclerosis   however it is not clearuntil now if ppar betadelta activation can be consideredis foras an ace inhibitormimicking approach as itexample the case for ppar gamma activators antiangiogenicantimetastatic 0cppar researchthe relevance offurthermorethis hypothetical pparbetadelta feature might be limited for tumor angiogenesiswhere vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and atherosclerosis do not contribute to the major pathologybesides inducing angiogenesis it has been demonstratedthat ppar betadelta directly acts on early epc through activation of the akt pathway and induces an enhanced vasculogenesis   similarlythe ppar betadeltamediatedprovasculogenic eï¬ects are also observed on late epc  he   showed that ppar betadelta activation withgw501516 induced epc proliferation and tube formationwhereas epc treated with an inhibitor of cyclooxygenasecox or pgi2 synthase or with ppar betadeltaspeciï¬csirna also displayed an opposite eï¬ect   furthermoreit has been demonstrated that ppar betadelta inducesangiogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration throughmatrix metalloproteinase mmp 9mediated insulinlikegrowth factor1 paracrine networks upon epc activation  han   also observed that ppar betadelta activationpromoted a rapid wound healing with enhanced angiogenesis in a mouse model with skin punch wound   overallin addition to ec ppar betadelta is also a key regulator ofepc or even may act as an initiator of activation of epc tofurther induce vasculogenesis ppar betadelta and tumor angiogenesislinked to tumor microenvironmentppar betadelta expression is often upregulated and promotes cancer progression in many major human cancerslung breast and gastric cancers []such as colonwhich suggests a crucial role of ppar betadelta in cancercells even though there exist some conï¬icting studies indicating that the functional role of ppar betadelta in tumorigenesis or carcinogenesis still remains highly controversial [] and dependent on speciï¬c tumor or cancer cell typesthus here we discuss the promotion of ppar betadelta intumor progression through facilitating tumor angiogenesisppar betadelta has been suggested as a critical hubnode transcriptional factor which governs a tumor angiogenic switch [ ] in the transcriptional networkanalysis it was reported that tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis were markedly inhibited in ppar betadeltanullmice in comparison with wildtype mice   moreoverthe elevated ppar betadelta expression level was also considered to be highly correlated to pathologically advancedtumor stage and increased cancer risk for recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer   indicating the crucial association of ppar betadelta withtumor angiogenesis progression and cancer invasivenessppar betadelta may indirectly facilitate tumor angiogenesis and progression through its function on the tumormicroenvironment tme where tumor angiogenesis is fostered moreover a tumor also releases some extracellular signals to closely communicate and constantly collaborate withtme to facilitate tumor angiogenesis in order to furtherenable tumor growth and progression for instance it wasshown that colon cancer cells with ppar betadelta knockoutfailed to stimulate ec vascularization in response to hypoxicstress whereas wildtype cells exposed to hypoxia were ableto induce angiogenesis [ ] suggesting that ppar betadelta is required for the promotion of angiogenesis in hypoxic stressmediated tme moreover in the tme tumorltrating myeloid cells are considered as the most important cells for fostering tumor angiogenesis among the multiple diï¬erent kinds of stromal cells   besides stimulatingtumor angiogenesis tumor myeloid cells also support tumrowth by suppressing tumor immunity and promotingtumor metastasis to distinct sites   interestingly it hasbeen demonstrated that ppar betadelta activation intumorltrating myeloid cells stimulates cancer cell invasion and facilitates tumor angiogenesis via an interleukin il10 dependent manner   moreover impairedtumor growth and angiogenesis were observed in pparbetadelta ko bmt mice due to ppar betadelta deï¬ciencyin tumor myeloid cells   suggesting that ppar betadeltaplays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and progression intumor myeloid cells of tmefurthermore the endoplasmic reticulum er an essential anelle involved in many cellular functions is implicated in tme in cancer stressors like hypoxia nutrientdeprivation and acidosis disrupt er function and lead toaccumulation of unfolded proteins in er a condition knownas er stress cells adapt to er stress by activating an integrated signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response upr upr represents a survival response bythe cells to restore er homeostasis and has both survivaland cell death eï¬ects the mechanisms that determine cellfate during er stress are not well understood for instanceshort exposure to er stress initially increases akt signalingbut longterm er stress suppresses akt signaling  ppar betadelta activation has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum er stressassociated ammation inskeletal muscle through an ampkdependent mechanism  and to reduce ammation in response to chronic erstress in cardiac cells   furthermore it has been nicelyshown that ppar betadelta can repress rasoncogeneinduced er stress to promote senescence in tumors   thisis mediated through the decrease of pakt activity promoting cellular senescence through upregulation of p53 and p27expression   it would be interesting to investigate thedirect eï¬ects of ppar betadelta on senescence of tumorendothelial cells in an in vivo setting we recently showedthat senescent endothelial cells are indispensable for ahealthy lifespan and that removal of senescent endotheliumdisrupts vascular function leading to diminished vessel densities and ï¬brotic lesions   if ppar betadelta mediatessenescence of tumor endothelium thereby protecting vesselintegrity this might explain the enhanced tumor growthand vascularization upon ppar betadelta activationobserved by us and others [  ]most recently zuo   demonstrated that pparbetadelta in cancer cells regulates tumor angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro by promoting the secretion of proangiogenic factors including vegf and interleukin  il8  most importantly in our recent works it has beenshown that conditionalinducible vascular endotheliumspeciï¬c ppar betadelta overexpression in vivo leads to 0cppar researchenhanced tumor angiogenesis tumor growth and metastasis formationfurther indicating a vascular ecspeciï¬cppar betadelta action mechanism in tumor progressionindependent of some controversial observations of pparbetadelta in speciï¬c tumor or cancer cell types   wagner   also ï¬rstly reported the mouse model in whichrapid induction of cardiac angiogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy were observed [ ] crosstalk between ppar betadelta and signalmolecules ppar betadelta activation or overexpressionmay upregulate the expression of its various downstream signal molecules involved in tumor angiogenesis includingproangiogenic factors such as vegf pdgf and fgfproinvasive matrixdegrading enzymes such as mmp9proammatory mediators such as cox2 and cytokinesand chemokines such as il1 and cxcl8 even some ofwhich have been further identiï¬ed as ppar betadelta directtarget genes besides a leading role of ppar betadelta amongthe signal molecules ppar betadelta may function in tmelinked to diverse kinds of cells through direct or indirectmodulation of its downstream molecules interplay between ppar betadelta and ammatoryangiogenesis ammatory angiogenesis is a crucial processin tumor progression for instance the proammatorymediator cyclooxygenase2 cox2 is considered as a keyregulator of angiogenesis and tumor growth through multiple downstream proangiogenic mechanisms such as production of vegf and induction of mmps moreover selectiveinhibition of cox2 has also been shown to suppress angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro   it is well known that vegfaplays a critical role in both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis  and it leads the directional migration of tip cells andstalk cell proliferation in microtubule branches [ ] ithas also been demonstrated that mmp9 triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis and enhances the availability of vegf to its receptors   furthermore it hasbeen reported that ammatory cell mmp9 initiates theonset of tumor neovascularization during which there existsfunctionalincludingmmp9   leptin is shown to mediate angiogenesisin vivo and in vitro through induction of ec proliferationand expression of mmp2 and mmp9   and to furtherpromote ec diï¬erentiation and directional migrationthrough enhancement of cox2 activity   leptin couldalso induce angiogenesis via transactivation of vegfr inecs   additionally besides inducing angiogenesisppar betadelta also functions in chronic ammationfacilitating tumorigenesis through induction of cox2 andits product prostaglandin e2 pge2 in vivo [ ]interestingly cox2 vegf mmp9 and leptin have beenidentiï¬ed as ppar betadelta target genes via a direct transcriptional activation mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells   colorectal cancer cells [ ] epcs[ ] and liposarcoma cells   respectivelylinks between vegf and mmpsin tme tumorltrating ammatory cells also helpto induce and sustain tumor angiogenesis and further tofacilitate tissue invasion and tumor metastatic spread byreleasing some signal molecules such as proinvasive mmp9and ammatory chemokines [] chemotaxis is alsoa crucial process for inducing angiogenesis in tumors eitherdirectly by attracting ecs towards tumor cells to form newvessels or indirectly by mediating immune ammatorycells to ltrate eventually promoting tumor angiogenesis  chemotaxis of tumor cells and stromal cells in tmeis also required for tumor dissemination during tumor progression and metastasis [ ]cxc chemokines such as cxcl8 encoding il8 andcxcl5 are also involved in cox2associated angiogenesisto contribute to nonsmallcelllung cancer progression[ ] it is further shown that il8 directly regulatesangiogenesis via recruitment of neutrophils   whichfurther drives vegf activation   moreoveril8responding neutrophils are considered as the major sourceof angiogenesisinducing mmp9 [ ] chemokine cc motif ligand  ccl2 in addition to the promotionof angiogenesis [ ] also enhances tumor

proangiogenic factorssuch as vegf cxcl8plateletderived growth factor pdgf and transforminggrowth factor beta tgf beta [] in fact bothtgf beta and hypoxia are potentinducers of vegfexpression in tumor cells and collaborate with tme toprovide the foundation of tumor angiogenesis and cancercell invasion   importantly il8 has been reported asa key target gene of ppar betadelta to promote angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro   and ccl2 expression isalso signiï¬cantly upregulated upon vascular ppar betadelta overexpression in vivo  suppressorcellscox2 also mediates il1 betainduced angiogenesisin vitro and in vivo [ ] il1 beta supports neovascularization through the regulation of the expression of vegfand its receptor vegfr2 flk1kdr on ecs   il1 actsas an upstream proammatory mediator that initiates anddisseminates the ammatory state by inducing a localinteractive network and increasing adhesion moleculeexpression on ecs and leukocytes which facilitates tumorassociated angiogenesis   in tme ammatory il1beta recruits myeloid cells from bone marrow and activatesthem to produce proangiogenic factors such as vegf vegffurther activates ecs and myeloid cells promoting tumorinvasiveness and fostering tumor angiogenesis   in addition il6 also stimulates angiogenesis and vasculogenesis[ ] however gopinathan   observed an il6induced newly forming vascular structure with defectivepericyte pc coverage ex vivo   thus facilitating cancercell ltration and tumor metastasis through vascular leakage interestingly il1 and il6 expression levels are signiï¬cantly upregulated in the ppar betadelta overexpressionmouse model reported recently  in summary ppar betadelta seems to act as a key leaderin ammatory mediatordriven tumor angiogenesis linkedto tme in which many proammatory mediators chemokines and proangiogenic factors closely communicate with 0cppar researcheach other and also associate with tumorltrating myeloid cells such as neutrophils tams and mdscs other key ppar betadeltamediated proangiogenicfactors it has been demonstrated that wilms tumor suppressor wt1 is a major regulator of tumor neovascularization andtumor progression   e26 avian leukemia oncogene ets1 also plays a key role in regulating vascular development and haemopoiesis particularly in angiogenesis  in addition ets1 promotes cancer cell invasion throughupregulation of mmps   consistent with this silencingof ets1 in highly invasive breast cancer cells also reducesthe expression of mmp9 and mmp1  ets1 also acts as a key regulator of mmps such asmmp1 mmp3 and mmp9 in human cancerassociatedï¬broblasts cafs [ ] cafs support tumor growthby secreting growth factors such as vegf fgf pdgf andchemokines to stimulate angiogenesis and thereby promotecancer cell invasion and metastasis formation [ ]cafs as metastatic tumor stroma are a crucial componentin tumor progression through the remodeling of the ecmstructure thus helping a tumor to acquire an aggressive phenotype [ ] ppar betadelta in cafs also exhibits aprotumorigenic eï¬ect it was reported that ablation of pparbetadelta in cafs attenuated tumor growth by altering theredox balance in tme   suggesting that ppar betadeltain cafs is also an important player in tumor developmentets1 induces the expression of vegf vegfr1 andvegfr2 in ecs [] in turn vegf is also a majorinducer of ets1 in ecs through the activation of either thepi3kakt pathway or the mekerk12 signal cascade[ ] wt1 is also reported to regulate tumor angiogenesis via direct transactivation of ets1  sryrelated hmgbox  sox18 has also beenreported previously to induce angiogenesis during tissuerepair and wound healing   and cancer progression  and most recently it was further shown that speciï¬cecderived endovascular progenitors initiated a vasculogenic process and diï¬erentiated into more mature endothelial phenotypes within the core of the growing tumorsthrough reactivation of sox18   interestingly theseimportant proangiogenic molecules including wt1 ets1and sox18 are also signiï¬cantly upregulated in the vascularppar betadelta overexpression model in vivo   andwt1 is also identiï¬ed as a target gene of ppar betadeltain melanoma cells   ppar betadelta may facilitate cancer progression atdiverse cellular levels in tme ppar betadelta activationis shown to induce colonic cancer stem cell csc expansionand to promote the liver metastasis of colorectal cancerin vivo via direct transactivation of the nanog gene  nanog as a key transcriptional factor governs the selfrenewal and pluripotency of stem cells   and cancer cellsexpressing nanog also often exhibit stem cell properties  protooncogene ckitcd117 is known as the maststem cell factor receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase andits activation in cscs may regulate the stemness to controltumor progression and drug resistance to tyrosine kinaseinhibitors moreover ckit has been identiï¬ed as a potentialmarker of the cancer stemlike cells   in addition ckitnot only functions on ecs [ ] but also belongs to thetumor angiogenesispromoting molecule [] studiesalso suggested that activation of ckit enhances the expression of vegf that can be suppressed by imatinib an inhibitor of ckit in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells whichthereby has an impact on tumor angiogenesis [ ] ckit is also involved in pathological ocular neovascularization   and is regulated transcriptionally by wt1  and ppar betadelta  pdgfb and its receptor pdgfr beta also known asangiogenic factors are suggested to enhance angiogenesisand vasculogenesis via their function in ecs [] andepcs   and to regulate vascular permeability and vesselmaturation through recruitment of pericytes pcs   and smooth muscle cells smcs   in newly formingvessels moreover pdgfb and pdgfr beta also interactwith other proangiogenic factors such as fgf2 [ ]vegfa and its receptor vegfr2   furthermorepdgfb and pdgfr beta may also aï¬ect cancer growthand progression by directly acting on tme besides thecrosstalk with cafs [] pdgfr beta in stromalï¬broblasts may mediate pdgfbinduced tam recruitment  thus implicating a role of pdgfr beta in tumorstroma to facilitate tumor progression most recently it wasfurther shown that speciï¬c targeting of pdgfr beta kinaseactivity in tme inhibited cancer growth and vascularizationin cancers with high pdgfb expression such as llc  therefore this indicates the diverse role of pdgfb andpdgfr beta in facilitating tumor angiogenesis and progression at diï¬erent cellular levels in tme pdgfr beta is demonstrated as a target of telomeric repeat binding factor trf2 that is further activated transcriptionally by wt1  pdgfb and pdgfr beta have further been identiï¬edas critical targets of ppar betadelta via a direct transactivation mechanism in vivo  in conclusion a variety of key signal molecules involvedin tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression and metastasishave either been identiï¬ed as ppar betadelta direct targetsor largely upregulated in the vascular ppar betadelta overexpression model in vivo reported recently   thus pparbetadelta activation seems to give rise to a highly angiogenicphenotype and even plays a hallmark role in promotingtumor angiogenesis and progression interestingly it appearsthat there could also exist a widely interactive networkbetween the downstream protumorangiogenic moleculesas described above therefore the crosstalk network is established between ppar betadelta and the various signal molecules and also between those molecules figure

ossn for pre and postsurgical treatmentthe association of scc with hpv was not confirmed because the number of cases wassmall in addition our results may not be accurate because we did not use multiplex pcrwhich is currently the most suitable genotyping method  ours is the first report to show that differences in the expression form and mutations inegfr in ossn are associated with prognosis and treatmentin an animal model egfr inhibition affected epithelial cell proliferation and stratificationduring corneal epithelial wound healing and may play a role in maintaining normal cornealepithelial thickness  gefitinib is an egfr inhibitor and is the first approved molecular targeted therapy for cancer treatment in japan   thus understanding the pathological role of egfr in ossn andapplying it to treatment are of great significance for seeking new treatment indications inossn including conjunctival sccs in this study egfr may translocate from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm tumor cells may transfer egfr into the cytoplasm by endocytosisto avoid excessive signaling by the feedback system fig    furthermore in this study theegfr mutation was present in many patients with ossn this finding may suggest a courseof treatment in the future in addition the method we used for identification of egfr mutations was not general genotyping but was a judgment of immunohistochemically stained sections although the sensitivity and specificity were high in a previous report this is still alimitation   one  101371 pone0238120 august     one 0cegfr in conjunctival

beensufficiently investigated our study found that egfr mutations were also present in conjunctival scc in east asians however we did not obtain results that correlated with the final prognosis further studies including further multiinstitutional studies and an increase in thenumber of cases will be needed in the future another limitation is that double testing of formalinfixed paraffinembedded specimens and plasma with realtime pcr for detection ofegfr mutations is more common than ihc in actual clinical practice according to the literature both the sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for these two types of mutations  in addition the size of our study cohort was small n   and the length of followup lessthan  year in some patients may not have been sufficient for longterm outcome analysestherefore additional studies will be needed to corroborate our findingsin  the results of this study indicate that egfr is an active molecular target inthe pathology of ossn including scc and is a prognostic factor the finding also suggests thatdiscovery of mutations may have important implications for future treatment optionssupporting informations1

noninvasive ucs and a significant number of miucs this subtype isenriched for papillary histology   is less aggressive and has a more favorable patient outcome [ ] basal classified tumors have a poorer overall survival compared to luminal tumors  they often exhibit squamous differentiation are aggressive and found exclusively inmiuc that metastasize and spread to distal ans   about  of miucs arise independent of the papillary pathway have poor outcomes and an overall  year survival rate of  environmental exposure to arsenite as3 has a strong association with the developmentof human uc the increased risk of uc correlates to the same endemic areas of the worldwhere populations have been identified with arsenicinduced skin cancer [] we havedeveloped a cell culture model of arsenicinduced urothelial cancer by exposing the immortalized nontumorigenic urothelial cell line urotsa to arsenite these transformed cell lines produce tumors in athymic mice that express genes for keratin krt     and  asignature pattern highly similar to the basal subtype of human miuc [ ] the tumorshave a histology similar to urothelialtransitional cell carcinomas with focal areas of squamousdifferentiation [ ] which is associated with poor prognosis [ ]the molecular mechanism driving a tumor towards a basalsquamous subtype is currentlyunknown in a recent study yamashita     show that transcription factor activatingprotein  alpha tfap2a is expressed at high levels in basalsquamous bladder cancerenriched in areas of squamous differentiation and is associated with increase lymph nodemetastasis and distant recurrence of the disease the study also shows that increased expression of tfap2a can facilitate the expression of other transcription factors such as tumor protein p63 tp63p63 also known as p63 which is known to be associated with the basalsubtype of uc   palmbos     demonstrated that p63 binds to the transcriptional regulatory regions of the gene ataxiatelangiectasia group d complementing gene atdc alsoknown as trim29 and krt14 thus increasing their expression the study further showedthat both krt14 and trim29 promote the invasion of the basal subtype of uc in vitro and invivo the luminal subtype of uc is associated with the expression of the transcriptional factorsforkhead box protein a1 foxa1 gata binding protein  gata3 and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma pparÎ [ ] the activation of pparÎ with an agonistcan represses the expression of tfap2a   and inhibit squamous differentiation in vitro the exact role of pparÎ signaling in carcinogenesis is somewhat unclear however theexpression of pparÎ in bladder cancers is a favorable prognostic marker   both in vivoand in vitro studies indicate that pparÎ ligands such as troglitizone can promote

treatment of these cells with the pparÎ agonist tginduced the expression of pparÎ as well as gata3 but not foxa1 in mortal human urothelial cells treatment with the pparÎ agonist shows an increase in the expression of the transcription factor foxa1   and this is contrary to what is seen in our study these differencescould be due to the cell type since we are using immortalized cells the as3transformedurotsa cells showed an induction in the expression of pparÎ and foxa1 when treated withtg however the expression of gata3 in these transformed lines was not consistent in bccell lines studies by others have shown that have shown that gata3 and foxa1 cooperatewith pparÎ activation to drive the differentiation of a basal bladder cancer subtype to a moredifferentiated luminal subtype   other studies have also linked the expression of foxa1 tothe development of the luminal subtype of urothelial cancer [] in our studies treatmentwith tg did result in the differentiation of the

linessignaling via the pparÎ pathway is essential for the growth arrest and terminal differentiation of adipocytes   and other normal epithelial [] and cancer cells [] whereassignaling via the egfr receptor plays a role in cell proliferation the keratins play an essentialrole in the differentiation of epithelial cells and different keratin profiles are expressed at different stages of differentiation the normal bladder has three different stages of differentiationand these stages are marked by the expression of krt14 krt5 and krt20   krt14 isexpressed in a subset of basal cells that are thought to play a role in regeneration as well astumorigenesis   whereas other basal cells and intermediate cells in the normal bladderexpress krt5 the expression of krt20 is restricted to the most differentiated cells theumbrella cells   these differentiation stages of the bladder are shared by bladder cancersand malignant transformation can occur in any of the different cell types of the bladder theexpression of krt14 is seen in the least of the differentiated tumors and its expression correlates to poor prognosis krt14   whereas the expression of krt20 is restricted to differentiated bladder cancers and its expression is associated with good prognosis   a study doneby varley     showed that normal human urothelial cells in culture express krt14 andlack the expression of krt13 and krt20 activation of pparÎ in these cells induced theexpression of krt13 and decreased the expression of krt14 this effect was significantlyenhanced when</th>\n",

extracellular matrix ecm [ ] during carcinogenesis is often perturbed and deregulated while during embryonic development isstrictly controlled to maintain homeostasis   in tumors the composition of the ecm differsfrom that of normal tissue and enables new interactions that affect the function of cancer cellsand are critical in modulating invasion associated with cell migration and growth the tumorassociated ecm presents several tumorassociated antigens that are generally more abundant one  101371 pone0237889 august     one 0cdownregulation of tenascinc inhibits breast cancer cells developmentand possibly more stable than those of the cell surface [] consequently these proteins represent possible valuable targets for tumor imaging and therapy [ ] ecm proteins such as fibronectin fn and tenascin have isoforms that are expressed in a tissue specific manner generatedby alternative splicing of their primary transcripts one of the most consistent isoform changesin the

[] numerous isoforms of tnc can beproduced through alternative splicing of nine fibronectin type iii regions between repeats  and at the premrna level there is a considerable amount of literature on the contribution of different splicingdependent tnc domains in specific biological functions   changes in thetnc isoforms expression pattern have been then described in a number of malignancies

discoverythat tnc presents a dominant epitope in glioblastoma prompted us to investigate the potentialof atnrna to block the tnc expression and its effect on the growth of human breast cancers where tnc overexpression was also established and linked with the highest malignancyinvasion capability and metastasis ability this view is supported by mock   who showedthat gbm patients with antibodies against the egflike repeats of tnc antibody targetvcedgftgpdcae have a significantly better prognosis than other patients   thus weassumed that in the light of the satisfactory results of brain tumors

concentrations did not display a smooth contour following  h oftreatment and subsequently their round shape was markedly altered by the treatments afterthe treatment with 50nm concentrations the spheroids showed the strong overrepresentationof dead cells fig 7b thus the 100nm concentration of atnrna was most likely too highfor the cells viability and we were not able to keep the spheroids in

main emt markers ecadherin and vimentinwestern blot analysis shows the significant increase of ecadherin level followed by the dropof the expression of vimentin protein fig 8a these observations were concentrationdependent showing the highest efficacy for atnrna at the concentration of 100nm for ecadherin expression similarly for vimentin we have observed the highest decrease of expressionupon atnrna transfection at 100nm concentration fig 8bdiscussiontnc is the main ecm protein of various tumors and its overexpression is repeatedlyobserved in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo indicating a role for this extracellularmatrix glycoprotein in neoplastic pathology moreover its high expression correlates withworsened patient survival prognosis in several cancer types   in breast cancers severalstudies demonstrate that high expression of tnc is not only an indicator of poor prognosisbut also correlates with metastasis to distinct ans such as lymph nodes liver and lung [] tnc plays a substantial role in emt that is believed to be a key mechanism in cancer progression whereby cancer cells acquire more aggressive behavior [ ] in human breast cancer specimens tnc is

induce an emt like phenotype in mcf7 breast cancer cells via theÎ±vÎ²6 and Î±vÎ²1 integrins [ ] many studies on various cancer tissues have demonstrateddownregulation of epithelial markers including ecadherin plakoglobin and cytokeratin aswell as the upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as ncadherin and vimentin andexpression of emt transcription factors snai  and twist since these changes towardsmesenchymal phenotype could correlate with invasiveness metastatic potential and poorpatients outcome we have investigated the effect of tnc knockdown on the expression levelsof emt markers our results show that down regulation of tnc reverses the malignant phenotype of the cancer cells as the experimental result we observed the downregulation of mesenchymal markervimentin followed by the upregulation of epithelial markerecadherinthis indicates atnrna as a potential therapeutic agent which could switch the mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells to the epithelial one

an antiadhesiverole which would affect the cell migration and invasion ability in addition to emt processesthus tnc downregulation seems to enhances the adhesiveness of cancer cells showing thedirect involvement of tnc in cell adhesive properties targeting the tnc in potential therapymight be also highly beneficial since it has been already established that tnc maintain a stemcell niche in the brain tumors thus could promote the tumor cell invasion therefore its overexpression largely contributes to radiochemotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence infact it has been shown that targeting gbm invasion increases tumor sensitivity to temozolomide   tnc also promotes stromal events such as the angiogenic switch and the formationof more but leaky blood vessels involving wnt signaling and inhibition of dickkopf1 dkk1in a neuroendocrine tumor model  we observed significant atnrnamediated downregulation of tnc was in concordance with the observed changes in proliferation and migration rates the results show thatthe atnrna transfected cells lose their ability to migrate thus showing the involvement oftnc in breast cancer invasiveness our data indicate also that the downregulation of tncexpression in mdamb231 cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation along with induction of celldeath we were able to determine the tnc impact on the apoptosis by measuring level of bothcaspases initiating intracellular events caspase2   and effector caspases3  and orend     demonstrated that tnc causes cdk2 inactivation and blocks cell cycle progression from g1 phase to s phase of anchoragedependent fibroblasts by interfering withfibronectinsyndecan4 interactions for the proliferation of anchoragedependent cellsattachment to the ecm is required detachment of fibroblasts by a pure tenascinc substratum results in g1phase arrest by inactivation of the cdk2 complex in a ckidependent manner   in contrast to fibroblasts proliferation of most tumor cells is stimulated by tnc  this shows that the effect of tnc on proliferation is cell typespecific and suggests that in cancer cells the cdk2 complex is not repressed in the presence of tnc in leukemia breast carcinoma and glioma were found subpopulations of stemlike cells that support tumor growth  in such cells adhesion on the tnc substratum may override the g0g1 and gls cellcycle checkpoints which may explain the increased proliferation rate   the g1s transitionis enforced by cyclin ecdk2 activation via syndecan4 related signalling it has been shownthat tnc in tumor cells binds to the syndecan4 binding site in fibronectin thereby blockingsyndecan4 ligation releasing the tumor cells from the suppressive effect of fibronectin ontheir proliferation   this would a</th>\n",

research is needed to inform subcutaneous infusion therapy in a variety ofpopulations including pediatrics and palliative care and medications and clarifying themechanism of deliveryintroductioninfusion therapy is a common treatment modality to deliver medications and fluids in theacute and home care settings and is gaining prevalence in the longterm care setting traditionally these parenteral therapies have been delivered via the intravenous route howevervenous depletion is a growing concern with an increasing aging population and patients withlongterm complex comorbidities [] the problems of venous depletion are compoundedby unnecessary peripheral venipuncture which add to patient physical and psychologicaltrauma compromised intravenousrelated outcomes suboptimal use of healthcare resourcesand increased costs [ ] additionally infusion therapy is moving beyond the boundariesof the acute care and home care sector to hospices and longterm care facilities   recentlypublished vascular access planning tools are either oriented primarily to the acute care settingor do not address the option of subcutaneous access [ ]the infusion therapy standards of practice recommend consideration of subcutaneousaccess for the administration of isotonic solutions and for continuous opioid and other infusion therapiesmedications eg immunoglobulin therapy   subcutaneous access isachieved through the placement of a small catheter in the subcutaneous tissue with the infusate absorbed from this space into the circulatory system this route has the advantages ofrequiring a small catheter and less technical insertion skills than that used for intravenousaccess with its ease of application lending to its use in multiple settings   additionallytime to place the catheter is less and fewer complications are likely resulting in cost benefits[ ] although practiced since  there has been a slow uptake in part due to a lack offamiliarity with the technique among physicians and healthcare professionals and perceivedsuboptimal outcomes eg hypovolemic shock due to inappropriate use of hydration solutions [ ] in our scoping literature search to prepare for a systematic review of primarystudies numerous systematic reviews were identified however each either had a narrowscope addressing one treatment eg fisher and colleagues review of iron overload management   or provided limited literature search or limited evidence eg duemsnoreiga andblascos   review of subcutaneous fluid and drug deliverygiven the worlds aging population health care systems rapidly changing diversity in practice setting and complexity of care and patient health conditions the uptake and use of subcutaneous continuous infusions may help address these issues and challenges the aim of ourstudy is to determine the effectiveness safety acceptability and efficiency related to the use ofsubcutaneous infusion sci as an alternate route to intravenous for the

of death data cod but no crosscountryanalysis has been done to verify how different or similar patterns of diagnostic errors anddata quality are in countries or how they are related to the local

severityof garbage codes ie codes that provide little or no information about the true underlyingcod garbage codes were classified into four groups based on the severity of the error inthe code the

moreover the cause of death patternidentified from the data is likely to seriously underrepresent the true extent of the leadingcauses of death in the population with very significant consequences for health priority setting garbage codes are prevalent at all ages contrary to expectations further researchinto effective strategies deployed in these countries to improve data quality can informefforts elsewhere to improve cod reporting systemsintroductiona key source of evidence for targeting health interventions to improve population health ishigh quality cause of death cod data that reliably document trends in mortality for differentdiseases and injuries   however several studies have demonstrated that policy and practicein many countries are based on data that are far from accurate [] in order to target effortsto improve the utility of cod data for policy it is important to first understand what the keydiagnostic errors area major problem with cod data is poor cause of death certification practices that result ingarbage codes ie codes that provide little or no information about the true underlying causeof death   garbage codes include what are often called illdefined causes but encompass alarger universe of uninformative diagnoses the major consequence of garbage codes is thatthey obscure the true mortality pattern in a population for example if a death certificate onlystates septicemia as the cause of death there is no way of knowing whether this resulted forexample from an infected wound following an accident from a postoperative amputationdue to diabetes or from meningitis or pneumonia each of which would require different preventive strategies if the underlying cause that led to septicemia is not indicated on the deathcertificate public policy to prevent these deaths would be misinformed potentially leading toinefficient resource allocation to prevent themcod data provide the essential health intelligence for health policies across countries atvarious levels of socioeconomic development our premise is that a better understanding ofgarbage codes ie their levels and patterns in countries at different stages of

data are [] but there has not been any crosscountry analysis ofdata quality across a range of socioeconomic development levels and cod reporting systemsusing the common anaconda frameworkthe implication of our findings for public policy to improve population health is that if therelationship is found to be very weak or nonexistent then efforts to improve national civilregistration and vital statistics systems can expect to make significant progress towardsimproving the evidence base for policy without depending on further socioeconomicdevelopmentdata and methodswe carried out a

middle sdi and  high sdi countrieson the basis of the country specific icd10 codes used in gbd    the most severecertification and coding errors that can mislead policy and public health planning were identified and categorized into four groups the fourtier garbage code typology used in anaconda is based on the premise that some garbage codes are worse than others depending onhow serious their impact is for guiding or misguiding policy debates and will thus likely impactdisease and injury control strategies differently  ¢ level  very highcodes with serious policy implications these are causes for which thetrue underlying cod could in fact belong to any of three broad cause group ie it is impossible to establish whether the true cause was a communicable disease a noncommunicabledisease or because of an injury a good example being septicaemia reported as the underlying cause of death these are the most serious misdiagnoses among the universe of unusable codes since they could potentially grossly misinform understanding of the extent ofepidemiological transition in the population¢ level  highcodes with substantial implications for policy these are causes for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to belong to one or two of the three broad cause groupsfor example essential primary hypertension¢ level  mediumcodes with important implications for policy these are causes forwhich the true underlying cod is likely to be within the same icd chapter for exampleunspecified cancer and thus are of some policy value¢ level  lowcodes with limited implications for policy these are diagnoses for whichthe true underlying cod is likely to be confined to a single disease or injury category egunspecified stroke would still be assigned as a stroke death and not to some other diseasecategory the implications of unusable causes classified at this level will therefore be muchless important for public policy but a more specific code would have increased their utilityfor specific public health analysesa full list of the composition of specific icd10 garbage codes for each of the four severitylevels is given in s2 filegiven the considerable differences in population age structure between countries at highand low levels of socioeconomic development we age standardised the pattern of garbagecodes the point of agestandardising was to investigate whether countries with a comparatively old age structure and hence relatively high average age at death might expect to have agreater fraction of garbage codes simply because of the higher likelihood of multiple comorbidity in the elderly we used the global age distribution of deaths from the latest gbd studyas the standard   one  101371 pone0237539 august     one 0care cause of death data fit for purposein addition to diagnostic accuracy the ability of any dataset to describe the true mortalitypattern in a population also depends on how complete it is both in terms of capturing alldeaths that occur and in assigning each a cod completeness of the cod reporting ie thepercentage of actual deaths in a population that are assigned a cod for each of the  countries was calculated using the adairlopez empirical method incorporated into anaconda  the empirical method models the relationship between the crude death rate cdr andits principal determinants namely the age structure of the population and the overall level ofmortality as reflected by the level of child mortality the predicted cdr based on these inputvariables for a population is then compared with the observed cdr to estimate death registration completeness given that the model was built largely from historical data where the levelsof adult mortality and child mortality are closely correlated the predictions of completenessfor populations where this assumption is not valid such as those severely affected by hivshould be interpreted cautiouslydatasets that are both incomplete and have a high proportion of garbage codes provide limited insight into the true health status of a population we combined the proportion of unrecorded deaths with the amount of garbage codes to provide a summary measure of the utilityof the data for policy this indicator is particularly important when investigating data qualityin countries with low completeness where the data available may only come from hospitalsand other health facilities where diagnostic facilities and physician availability is greaterpotentially overstating the policy utility of the dataa key output of any mortality surveillance system is a table showing the leading causes ofdeath for the population in countries where garbage codes are commonly assigned they frequently appear among the  or  leading causes and can seriously impact the overall utilityof the cod data this is particularly the case when they permeate the top  leading causesand are high impact providing little or no useful information for policythe anaconda software tool specifically developed for assessing quality of mortalityand cod data was used to investigate each dataset s1 file to identify the pattern and extentof garbage codes in the data their frequency among the leading causes the completeness ofthe dataset and to provide an overall summary index of the quality of the output of the mortality data system namely the vital statistics performance index for quality vspiq  resultsthe proportion of garbage codes in the  country datasets varied substantially by countryranging from  to  see fig  while the relationship between sdi and amount of garbage codes in the data is broadly apparent the relatively low r2  arises from the presenceof outliers particularly uzbekistan kyrgyzstan nicaragua and colombia it is quite possiblethat specific certification and coding procedures have been introduced in these countries toavoid the use of garbage codes if these countries are omitted the strength of the inverse relationship is much more apparent further insights into the general characteristics of populationand mortality of the selected countries can be found in s2 filethe mean values for each sdi group indicate that on average countries of high sdi statushad a lower  proportion of garbage codes in their data than middle  and low sdi countries table  interestingly there was large intercountry variation in theuse of garbage codes within each sdi

surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity  for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ ] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity  evenfor subcentimeter lesions  [] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is advised for all patients according to the Japanese guideline however the level of evidenceis low

accuracy ofDiscussionThe purpose of the DIAPANC trial is to investigate thediagnosticcontrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI in patients with suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization

andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore DIAPANC will contribute to our knowledge ofliver metastases regarding incidence

to contribute to tumor progression More importantly DEGs based on the TME were identified asimportant prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients and two nomograms were developed for predicting the OS and DFS of osteosarcoma patientsrespectivelyIn recent years an increasing number of studiesfocused on the carcinogenesis and progression of tumorsbased on the TME and the ESTIMATE algorithm is oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   ] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  ] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence osteosarcoma remains unclear Finally inthe training cohort  and  DEGs were identified asOS and DFSrelated DEGs respectively However onlyfive OS and five DFSrelated genes were identified in thevalidation cohort The different age structures smaller 0cHu  BMC Cancer

characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFÎ±induced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples

conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ¥  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years  years  years  yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers Therefore there is an urgent needto establish a more appropriate age group classificationcriterion for better management of glioma patientsFor this purpose we conducted a retrospective studycollecting clinical data from  patients with histologically proven gliomas in Nanfang Hospital between and  Based

outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were  years old pediatric groupand  years old youth group  years oldmiddleaged group and ¥  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged  years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found

studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of

known about the characteristics ofdementia caregivers sleep and the factors that may influence sleep disruptionThe purpose of this study was to investigate the sleep characteristics and disturbances of Australian caregivers of aperson living with dementia In addition it evaluated the psychological wellbeing of caregivers by evaluatingassociations between mood and sleep in this populationMethods This study used a crosssectional descriptive correlation design Participants were recruited with theassistance of Alzheimers Australia Dementia Australia and targeted social media advertising In total  adultprimary informal caregivers of people with dementia participated completing a questionnaire on demographiccharacteristics the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale DASS21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PSQIResults In this study  of caregivers were female who had been caring for someone living with dementia onaverage for  years  of participants had two or more comorbidities namely cardiovascular disease osteoarthritisand diabetes  of participants were poor sleepers with  with difficulty initiating sleep and  reporting havingdifficulty maintaining sleep Overall psychological distress was common with high levels of moderate to severedepression anxiety and stress Global PSQI scores were significantly positively associated with depression and anxietywith the strongest correlation seen with stress scores Depression scores were also moderately associated with daytimedysfunction Stress was identified as a significant predictor of overall sleep qualityConclusions Sleep problems are common within the population of dementia caregivers Due to the nature andduration of caregiving and the progression of dementia of the care recipient there is the potential for a decline in thecaregivers mental and physical health Caregivers of those living with dementia are more likely to have comorbiditiesdepression anxiety and stress Sleep quality is correlated with emotional distress in dementia caregivers although thedirection of this association is unclear Therefore sleep and psychological wellbeing may be intertwined withimprovements in one aspect resulting in a

[]A further  million new cases of dementia worldwideare predicted each year [] as populations around theglobe continue to live longer [] These figures could bevery much under estimated as it is widely accepted thatbetween  and  of people affected have no formaldementia diagnosis [] This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults ¥ years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregivers own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the

caregivers reporting lower stress levelsand improved health after use [] Sleep disturbanceshave also been shown to be partially reversed for caregiversduring periods of respite care [] perhaps due to reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent

interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure

oncological clinical trials that setthe standards of antineoplastic treatment [ ]Over the last three decades the fiveyear survival ratefor all types of cancer has increased particularly in individuals aged  to  [ ] Still older patients are atmore risk of toxicity in anticancer therapies such aschemotherapy and require a benefitrisk assessmentprior to treatment [] A comprehensive geriatric assessment CGA is consequently recommended in these patients to diagnose comorbidities and optimize geriatricinterventions and to improve the functional state andpossibly the survival rate by ensuring better tolerance totreatment [ ] CGA has also shown predictive valuein identifying elderly patients with cancer who are exposed to a poor prognosisincluding a higher risk ofdeath during

therapeutic decision is required to assess the balance of benefits and risks of performing or not performing specificoncologic interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter

of the RxRisk indices which require updating if medicationbased measures ofmorbidity are to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworlds older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged ¥ yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV  two algorithms which determine an individualscurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs

in patients with pressure sores However SIBO is a potential cause of malnutrition in patients with SCI due to decreased intestinalmotility resulting from autonomic disturbances and reduced physical activity [] SCI is also a risk factor forpressure sores [] However to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports of an associationRBCHbPltTotal

concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than    CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed    CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than    CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less invasive than obtaining proximal small bowel content However there areno standardized criteria for diagnosing SIBO usingbreath tests [] We did not perform a breath test inour case studyDespite no previous reports of an association betweenunhealed pressure sores and SIBO nutritional status isknown to be important for the healing of pressure sores []In our case the sacral pressure sore which was initially refractory began to heal after starting treatment for SIBOAmong intrinsic factors related to the healing of pressuresores blood levels of hemoglobin albumin and zinc are especially important [] Our patient had anemia hypoalbuminemia and a low zinc concentration which graduallyimproved after starting treatment for SIBOSIBO is caused by multiple factors including disturbances in defense

injury completeness of cord injury and postinjury durations of years or more [] Moderate or severe grade depressivestatus is also associated with neurologic bowel dysfunction in SCI patients Of these risk factors our patienthad complete cord injury that had occurred more than years ago Also many bowel symptoms appear in patients with SCI eg constipation distension incontinence abdominal pain bowel accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  ] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that  of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated the absorbency disturbance andallowed healing of the pressure sore In light of severalcommon risk factors between pressure sores and SIBOsuch as decreased physical activity our case providesadditional
